       "{'content': \"This week, we'll talk about volunteering and open source work. We have a special guest today, Sara. Sara is a Google Developer expert in machine learning, a Google PhD fellow, and also a co-founder of AI Wonder Girls. She likes to demystify AI to empower individuals with tools and mindsets that require building solutions that matter to the community and humanity.\\n\\nWe met with Sara in October, I think, at a conference in Porto. It was an amazing conference. We had a very nice chat. Sara was talking about what she does and I thought “She would be an amazing guest.” And here we are 3, 4, 5 months after that, finally. [chuckles] So, welcome to the interview.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThe questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. As always, thanks, Johanna, for your help. Before we start – before we go into our main topic of open source work and volunteering – let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?\\n\\nYeah, sure. I got interested in AI in my first engineering year, back in 2016. We were part of an interesting journey called “Beyond Engineering” (educational engineering) where we had to contribute our engineering skills to help the locals. And that's actually what pushed me to start going this volunteering road, because I enjoyed it so much – giving back to the community and my skills that I wanted to do it as well. But from there, I started learning about what AI is. And obviously, like everyone, I started with Andrew Ng’s course, Machine Learning from Stanford.\\n\\nThat's how, after that, I got into [inaudible] deep learning [inaudible], so on and so forth. On the side, I was volunteering my skills with Omdena AI, and then got an interesting internship from STEM-Away. That's how I actually got to where I am now [chuckles] doing my PhD in AI applied to help. One of the reasons why I actually wanted to do a PhD was to get deep learning research –applied research in industry. Obviously, if you're going to be doing research, you do need some kind of research intensive – that's a PhD for you. [chuckles]\\n\\nAnd what is your background? What were your studies about?\\n\\nYeah. Actually, in our engineering, we were doing computer science. Our major was called Computer Science and Emerging Technologies Engineering. In our last year, I did a Big Data Engineering specialization.\\n\\nAnd then you liked it and you wanted to do more AI [Sara agrees] and this was a way…\\n\\nYeah, in that same year (in 2017) I was interested… I was actually part of a Big Data Challenge for EEE. When we did that internship, I was like, “I really want to do this.” I was enamored by computer vision because I'm a vision person, most of the time. That's how I got interested in computer vision, and then from computer vision, I was really interested in the medical field. I watch a lot of medical dramas. That's how I wanted to do AI Applied to help in mind.\\n\\nGrey's Anatomy?\\n\\nOh, I kind of watched that, but that wasn't my first choice. I usually prefer [inaudible] when it comes to doctor dramas because they're more thorough.\\n\\nYeah, I also know Scrubs, but I guess it's also not really a very medical show, right? [Sara agrees] [chuckles] Okay, so your focus is on AI and healthcare, right? [Sara agrees] So what is your PhD about?\\n\\nIt's about deep multi-modality learning for COVID-19 and IDT diagnosis. Practically, I am trying a bunch of CNM models and vision transformers. I mix and match, depending on the disease, different modalities. For example, for COVID, chest X-ray with CT – I feed them to the CNMs or the models I'm comparing to do a benchmark and see which models outperforms and which models for example… Which modality is actually much more efficient to our searching model than another? Why? And is it normal? For example, is it what doctors usually rely upon more than the other modality available on the modalities? That's practically, in simple words, what I'm doing. [chuckles]\\n\\nHow long have you been doing this?\\n\\nOh, this is like my fourth year. This is my final year. I'm just wrapping up the writing part.\\n\\nFinal year, okay. So now you're almost finished? Right?\\n\\nYes. No, no, I'm finished. I haven't done any experimentation for almost a year. Yeah.\\n\\nSo you've been writing papers for a year?\\n\\nNo, it’s more like I have been writing papers from the start of my PhD. My first paper was ready by… I believe it was November or something. It was ready, as it was circulating around journals. Because, by the way, the paper that was published just recently, just last year and this was the first paper that was written, all the other papers that have already been published, but it was still roaming around.\\n\\nAh, so it took a bit of time. [Sara agrees] You're also a Google PhD fellow. [Sara agrees] What does that mean and how did you get it?\\n\\nYeah. Actually, one of the things we don't have in Morocco, sadly, for now – we don't have funding for research. One of the things I had to do was find a funding source – a scholarship or something to help me support my studies. Way before that, I was involved in a lot of Google stuff, like with the GDG (Google Developers Groups). I knew they had a program called Google PhD Fellowship. I applied to it. I… What can I tell you? The thing is, if you want to apply for aid and you want to have a chance to be selected, please make sure that you focus on something they care about. For example, try to figure out what they're researching, especially, for example, a searching field – if you're doing it for healthcare. Figure out what they're interested in. Then the second thing is, it has to touch upon a SDG goal, like helping you or your community. And it has to help your community.\\n\\nThat means if you're in Morocco, or if you're in a certain region, it has to help your region do something – it's going to be useful if people leverage that research or something. I think that's why I got it, but I believe strongly that most of the reasons why I really got it was not just around the proposal, but also, obviously, my supervisor. And the second thing is all of the works I have already done way before applying to it. I have done a lot of volunteer work; I have touched a lot – I've been [involved with] all kinds of different AI and applied it to different domains. So I think that's one of the reasons why I got it. So what is it all about? Usually, in the fellowship – you can think of it like a scholarship because it kind of is like a scholarship. They give you money, right? For example $10,000 per year. By the way, they increased that – now it's $12,000. But usually it’s $10,000 a year for three years, depending on the region.\\n\\nFor example, Africa, this is what we have. I believe in the US, they only give them for one year, because usually they do have funding. What do they give you on top of the money, is they also give you a Google mentor and it's up to you to leverage this mentor or not. I am a very independent person. [chuckles] So I did almost everything by myself. Sometimes, when we had our meetings, I was like, “What do you think of my proposal?” “Is it relevant or not?” And then he would be like, “Yeah, it's interesting. You can go ahead with it.” That's practically much of our meeting. [chuckles] That's what I do in our meeting. Well, apart from that, there is the PhD Fellowship Summit that I invite you to – it's a virtual Summit, where obviously, there are all of the Google PhD fellows gathered together. Then Googlers talk about what they're doing in Google, in the research aspect – obviously, about AI.\\n\\nInteresting. You mentioned that one of the reasons you got this was the cause, and that it was helping the local community. [Sara agrees] Not only that, but also, because of all the previous work you had done – all the volunteering work, and that you applied the AI to a lot of things. Can you maybe tell us more about that? What kind of volunteering work have you done?\\n\\nMy first volunteering work was with Omdena – it was around the detection of post-traumatic stress disorder. In that project, we kind of, as always… I'm not sure if you know this, but in AI, most of the time, we have the problem with data – we have the problem of computational resources. We didn't have the data at the time. We kind of had to get creative regarding where we got it from. We were a bunch of AI engineers collaborating together to help figure out from certain discussions if a person had PTSD or not. We developed a chatbot for that.\\n\\nFor example, if we believed that that person had post traumatic stress disorder, we suggested resources based on DSM-5 and CAPS-5 (these are standard psychiatric guidelines that we referred to). Obviously, most of the time, we always refer them to the doctor, because with AI, you can never trust it.  This is one of the points. Apart from that, from then on, I started volunteering with Omdena more. I actually volunteered with their second project about trash out, which was about detecting if a certain trash is recyclable or not, using computer vision. For example, you have some kind of trash, and then you figure out if it's recyclable or not. Because every region in the world has its own regulations, on top of figuring out if it was recyclable or not, we had to figure it out… It depends on what type of actual trash it is, depending on the region. That was my second project with Omdena.\\n\\nMy third project was with Fruit Punch AI, and it was around detecting our cervicals. In our spine, we have curved because seven cervicals and we had to segment those. What they wanted us to do was to segment these cervicals so that they could actually plot a searching function where they… They tried to know if this movement that I'm doing right now is normal. If it is a normal movement.\\n\\nIn the neck only, right?\\n\\nYeah. Yes. They were trying to figure out if… For example, when someone had surgery to replace one of these cervicals, was the movement still the same as it is in normal settings? Because, what happened was that, when they replaced one of these cervicals, the “meat” kind of sticks to the new cervicals, and the neck doesn't move as normally as it could. So they wanted to know what the difference was? What was the factor that was helping us do all of this movement, and figuring out a solution for that.\",\n",
