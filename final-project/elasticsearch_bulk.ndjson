There are also good facilities in a number of other places – seeYachting Essentialsfor more details.\nThe Bahama Islands are a low-lying limestone archipelago in the North Atlantic southeast of Florida and north of Cuba and Hispaniola, covering 150,000 square miles of tropical sea with approximately 5,000 square miles of land. Of the 700 islands and many more rocks and small cays, some 25 are inhabited with communities. Many more have private homes and some whole islands are privately owned.\nThe population in 2019 was 395,00 and English is the language spoken by all.\nThe Bahamian Dollar is the currency of the Bahamas. For specifics seeGeneral Info.\nBahamian Standard Time operates on Eastern Standard Time. For more details seeGeneral Info.\nThe climate is tropical, with a hot and rainy season from May to October (in which, however, the breezes temper the heat) and a cooler season from November to April, which is felt more on the north-western islands. SeeWeatherbelow for more details.\nVery deep off-sounding trenches and shallow banks make the area an interesting cruising ground. Much navigation is by “eyeball” as, in good light and using Polarized sunglasses, depth is easily read by colour through the crystal clear water.Several new publicationsare now available to assist with safe navigation.\nCoral reefs provide excellent snorkeling and diving.

Most violent crime is against Bahamians, however, tourists should take precautions.\nCruisers should be especially vigilant in the larger populated areas of Nassau, New Province Island and Grand Bahama which are known for violent crime some times targeting tourists.\nGovernment guidelines advice is to be vigilant at all times and don’t walk alone away from the main hotels, tourist areas, beaches and downtown Nassau, particularly after dark. Take care if traveling on local bus services after dusk on routes away from the main tourist areas. Robbers may be armed. Don’t resist in the event of an attempted robbery.\nThe outlying islands of The Bahamas (known as the Family or Out Islands) have lower crime rates.\nMost violent crime is against Bahamians, however, tourists should take precautions.\nCruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when ashore.

Do not leave your drinks unattended.  There have been reports of sexual assaults on foreign nationals by jet ski operators in Nassau.\nDinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean. Be sure to lift, chain, and lock your dinghy and outboard when not in use, especially at night. When leaving your dinghy ashore, ensure that your dinghy and outboard are securely locked.\nAirTags and other cell based/Bluetooth tracking devices are being used by cruisers to track their dinghys/outboards. Some thieves are aware of this practice and may detect, locate and disable them. Understand the limitations of using tracking devices. (See thisMay 24 Jost Van Dyke, BVI CSSN report.) The use of GPS trackers (rather than Bluetooth trackers) is recommended. See thisReport by David Lyman.\nA new method of corruption appearing in Caribbean islands is for a “finders” fee to be demanded when a stolen dinghy is “found”.

The CUP (Cuban Peso) will be the only official currency. For details seeGeneral Info.  (Note:  US Dollars are accepted and in many cases most welcome!)\nThe country operates on Cuba Standard Time. For specifics seeGeneral Info.\nSpanish is the principal language of Cuba. Although many of the younger people speak some English almost none of the older people do, nor do most of the officials away from major towns.\nCuba has a Caribbean sub-tropical climate with a rainy hot and humid weather in summer and mild weather in winter. SeeWeather sectionfor more details.\nCubans are still restricted to only being allowed to own small boats, so there are very few locally owned sailing boats. Repair facilities are limited, but the engine and mechanical repairs well understood. It is advisable to be independent if cruising here and bring all marine supplies with you. For more details on yachting services seeYachting Essentials.\nOn the south coast, the marinas are smaller and busier, so it is not uncommon to have a waiting list for berths.

Under no circumstances should you arrive and anchor in a bay. Yachts may only clear in at a port of entry that also has a marina facility.\nThe US still maintains a military base at Guantanamo Bay on the SE extremity of the island.

If you have AIS on board it is likely the authorities will already be tracking you and will try to contact you via VHF and organize for officials to be there for your arrival.\nIn most ports, the harbormaster will answer in English. The following details should be communicated: name of the yacht, flag, port of registry, last port of call, intended port of arrival in Cuba with approximate ETA, type of yacht and number of people on board. The captain will then be given instructions to proceed.\nChannel 16 is also monitored by the marinas, however, getting hold of someone at a marina can be difficult.\nThe main port of entry for yachts is Hemingway Marina immediately to the west of Havana. All ports with marinas have tourist facilities and are used to clearing in yachts. The commercial port of Havana should not be entered as it has no provision for clearing yachts.\nOnce moored in port, wait for the officials to arrive and no one must go ashore until clearance is completed. You may be asked to anchor out for clearance. How many officials come on board will depend on the port, anywhere between 2 and 12 and possibly a sniffer dog as well.\nSeeDocumentsfor the paperwork required for clearing-in.\nNote:An exit zarpe from your last port is not necessarily required. Neither the USA or The Bahamas normally issue one.\nClearance must first be obtained from Quarantine health officials, after which are the visits by Immigration, Customs, Agriculture Department officials and Guarda Frontera (Coast Guard). These officials are based in the marina and clearance is usually completed promptly (2-3 hours), unless you have firearms aboard.\nCustoms will wrap up any satellite communciations and/or drone with tape, so that they can’t be used while in Cuba. They will want to know if you have bicycles/canoes/paddle board etc. on board and how many.\nOfficials are usually good-natured and whilst there is substantial paperwork to complete it all adds up to the excitement of visiting this country, which for so long has been off limits. Sometimes a small gift (such as coke or pen) or a tip is requested. You are not obliged to tip, and in many ports, a handout is frowned upon by the ranking official.\nOnce initial clearance is completed, a coastwise cruising permit (despacho de navegacion – Costera) can be obtained from the Coast Guard (Guarda Frontera) on departure. Be sure to advise the harbor master that you intend to cruise Cuba so the Guarda can be prepared. You must submit a cruising itinerary which has to be approved and the Coast Guard will keep track of you.\nThis permit currently allows you to cruise the waters of Cuba, it does not allow you to go ashore, except at a designated marina.\nWhen cruising along the coast, one must report to the Guarda Frontera office in every port. However, nearly everywhere you stop an official will row out to you, will ask for your details and be very pleased if you produce a Spanish version of the answers he requires as he can then fill in his forms ashore. The official will let you know if you are permitted to go ashore or not. He will want to know your time of departure, will take yourdespachoaway and, whatever time, will return it to you before you sail. All papers are usually inspected.\nOfficially yachts may only visit harbors and anchorages where there are marinas – except for the offshore cays.  No other anchorage or harbor may be visited and if it is, the captain and crew may not go ashore.\nTwenty-four hours’ notice of departure should be given, if possible, even if sailing to another port in Cuba.\nBefore departure, one must clear out with the Guarda Frontera at an official port of entry/exit. They will retain the despacho and issue a new exit despacho (clearance certificate) along with the cruising permit. One must also clear out with customs and immigration.\nUnder current US law  private American flagged vessels cannot legally enter Cuba unless they have an export permit issued issued by the US Dept of Commerce and a Permission to Enter the Territorial Waters of Cuba (CG3300) issued by the USCG. These permits are extremely difficult to obtain.See Restrictions for details.\nThat said, the Cubans give a warm welcome to American yachts.\nNote:American citizens sailing to Cuba on other flagged vessels will not have a problem entering the country.\nCuba Land and Sea (Facebook group for cruisers)Marina Hemingway, Havana: yachtclub@cnih.mh.tur.cu\nCuba Land and Sea (Facebook group for cruisers)\nMarina Hemingway, Havana: yachtclub@cnih.mh.tur.cu\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

The cruising FB groupCuba, Land and Seais an excellent source for information on the latest situation.\nRoad Safety:Accidents involving motor vehicles are the leading cause of accidental deaths in Cuba. The roads are often dangerous due to lack of road maintenance. Potholes and a lack of proper lighting make driving at night particularly dangerous. Cuban drivers tend to place large sticks or rocks in the road to indicate a hazard or broken down vehicle ahead. It is often difficult to see these accident markers until one has hit them.\nBe extremely vigilant when anchoring near populated areas. Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when leaving the boat or going ashore at night.

There may also be various “invented” fees, which are outlined on the individual port pages. This custom is a form of “direct tax” as the officials get paid so little per month. The entire country works on tips and commissions, so in short, get accustomed to it or don’t sail to the DR.\nSome marinas will offer a clearance service with an all-inclusive charge (including tips). Sometimes this is much simpler than visiting all the various offices, which for some can be lengthy and complicated.\nIt is customary to offer officials that board the boat a cold soft drink.\nBring USD cash for clearance (some marinas have ATMs).\nAny boat that comes into a DR harbor is under DR jurisdiction.  If they do not want to stay, the authorities may permit them to depart provided they have not set foot on land.  If they have set foot on land, then they must clear in and clear out.\nIn all DR ports, no departure is permitted after 18:00.\nThe Navy (Armada) issues thedespachofrom harbor to harbor.Despachosare issued only to “Puerto Habilitado” (Ports that have a clearing in and out facilities).

This can often take a few hours each visit, so allow enough time to deal with the formalities and remember that departure after 6pm is not permitted (so get to the Armada office early). In some places you may find the Armada will come out to you, often very early in the morning, to get your despacho from the previous port.

These rules apply to all vessels.\nNote, if you wish to cruise more than 60 days in the DR you will need to apply for a Navigation Permit from the Navy before the 60 days are up (see Customs for more details).\nWhen you are ready to leave the DR, you must get anInternational Despachofrom the Navy (cut-off time 6pm). Be sure to give 1-2 days notice as the authorities will have to board your vessel again for a security check as per international law (especially if you are sailing to USA/Puerto Rico).\nThe DR has agreements with the USA on security that have been imposed upon them by the US, so if a vessel is clearing out to sail to the US mainland, Puerto Rico or the US Virgin Islands, usually an additional step of bringing sniffer dogs on your boat will occur. For this reason, be sure to give plenty of notice that you wish to clear out to one of these countries so security checks can be properly arranged.\nDepending on where you are clearing to, you will be asked to pay a “tip” (not voluntary) for the time involved. For an easier check-out, pick a non-US destination and then take it from there.\nNote that once you have been issued with adespacho,you must depart within 1-2 hoursor yourdespachowill be taken away and you will have to obtain a new one the next day. Be sure to check in your port of departure what time restrictions are in place.\nIt is a serious offence not to obtain a despacho to clear out of the DR.\nPort Closures due to Heavy Seas and Swells\nIn some ports, despachoconditions might be more relaxed if you are simply moving to the next port with a domesticdespacho. However, don’t leave it too long otherwise the port you are sailing to may query the time it has taken for you to get to them.\nThe Armada will issue local and international despachos at the latest 6pm.\nPort Authority/Customs/Immigration hours are 0800-1600 – 7 days a week.\nAll harbors in the DR are on heightened alert as the vigilance against drug runners has increased, which can at times cause a short delay when clearing in or out.\nSome of the intermediate ports get more traffic and the officials at those ports are easier to deal with. Some ports or anchorages like Punta Macao on the east end have a reputation for asking for a fee for stopping, although such requests do not have to be honored.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

The below information has been updated, but refers to pre-crisis times.\nHaiti has no “official” ports of entry for sailing vessels; however inward clearance can be carried out at essentially any seaport that deals with commercial shipping. Local police officers can assist in this process as well.\nThat said, the only cruiser-safe area on Haiti is Ile a Vache, where the local population understand yachts and have services to assist visiting sailors.See the Ile a Vache port page for more details.\nAll harbors do not follow the same clearance procedure or charge the same price. The north side of the north peninsula (Labadie) has the most commercial traffic and they will look to capitalize on any yacht that calls there. On the south side of the country where there is less commercial traffic, it is definitely easier and less expensive to clear in (but there may be more of a run-around).\nLarger ports will treat you as they do commercial shipping, which can be expensive and complicated customs procedures. In smaller harbors, it is only necessary to clear with immigration.\nYacht crew should clear-in with Immigration (who will stamp a crew list if asked) and get passports stamped.\nAll that is required is a visit to Immigration.They will not give you any paperwork, such as a despacho/zarpe or departure documents. This may be a problem if you need one for your next port of call.If staying a short time it is probably possible to clear in and out at the same time.Entrance and departure fees vary depending on where you clear.

The law does require Customs clearance for anyone arriving with something to declare, but yachts do not usually have anything to declare. It is probably best to avoid the Customs office unless requested to do so.\nSemana is the government body charged with boat safety.  It was designed to protect Haitians for the many ferry boats that they use.  If a Semana inspector sees your boat he may very well visit you and ask for something in the way of a tip.  As the law is ambiguous as to whether he has jurisdiction over private yachts that do not carry passengers, one can beg off and refuse to pay anything or give a small gift.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

{"id": "jamaica_main", "country": "Jamaica", "section_type": "main", "url": "https://www.noonsite.com/place/jamaica/", "content": "Jamaica has a total population of 2.9 million people and is the third largest island in the Caribbean Sea, after Cuba and Hispaniola. The official language is English, but the primary spoken language is an English-based creole called Jamaican Patois (or Patwa).\nThe official currency in Jamaica is the Jamaican Dollar. All Inclusive resorts and key tourist areas also use US Dollars. For specifics, seeGeneral Info.\nJamaica observes Eastern Standard Time (UTC−05:00) all year and does not observe daylight saving time.\nFor most of the year, the easterly trades blow 20 knots. The southeast corner (Kingston to Portland Bight) has an average 5 knots higher. At night cool mountain air slides down the mountains to create an offshore breeze (Katabatic winds). Tidal variation in Jamaica is about one foot. SeeWeatherbelow for more details.\nCruising around Jamaica is varied with a multitude of anchorages, small fishing villags plus the inevitable over-developed tourist centers. One hindrance is that you have to check in and out of each port visited and finding a secluded beach with no development is probably the greatest challenge. Three weeks should give you plenty of time to circumnavigate the Island. Anchoring in Jamaica is normally fairly easy as the bottom is usually sand and turtle grass. The marina inPort Antonio, theMontego Bay Yacht Cluband theRoyal Jamaica Yacht Clubin Kingston are popular places with cruisers. All three facilities have very good security.\nThere are a great number of fish traps set off the coast of Jamaica. They normally extend out to the 100 feet mark and thus along the coast, one should keep a watchful eye. Keep about one mile offshore as you move around the island.\nRepair facilitiesare few and far between. All three docking facilities mentioned above can assist with a number of repair services, and the boatyards at Port Antonio and the Royal Jamaica Yacht Club have haul out facilities. For more details, seeYachting Essentials.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

At these docks, immigration and customs services, adequate facilities for mooring/docking, refueling and supplies, as well as security are in place, or are easily arranged.

For a full explanation of this service and other web clearance services in the Caribbean see report:Eastern Caribbean Cruising: Clearance Procedures Simplified. SailClear charges an annual subscription fee of US$25.\nThe Immigration Department has an online form that should be completed prior to arrival – go tohttps://travelslu.govt.lc/. Where it says “add family” this includes crew even if they are not related. While it appears to be for air arrivals, yachties are also expected to use this system.\nThe Health department has a Health Declaration that you can print off and fill out in advance if you wish –go here.\nIt is also possible to complete arrival paperwork at the Customs and Immigration offices (i.e. filling out paper forms in quadruplicate as in the old days). This is a slow process however and using the online pre-arrival portals will enable a much faster clearance.\nSt. Lucia Arrival Procedures for Yachts\nYou must obtain a customs clearance within 24 hours of arriving in St. Lucia or you will be fined. Do not leave your yacht before receiving clearance from customs officials (other than for emergency purposes).\nOn arrival in St. Lucia waters, raise your Q flag. Vessels must clear in immediately, without delay, or risk being fined.\nAll yachts must clear in with Port Health. There is a Port Health Unit at each of the 4 ports of entry – Vieux Fort, Soufriere, Marigot Bay and IGY Rodney Bay Marina. Filling in the Health Maritime Form and visiting the Port Health office is mandatory.\nCheck with Customs, or fellow cruisers, for the current check in order. A Cruiser reported in February 2025 that the order in Soufriere was (1) Customs, (2) Health, (3) Port Authority (payFees) and (4) Immigration.\nClearance Offices are open Monday to Saturday 0800-1800, and Sunday and holidays 0800-1600.

SeeFeesfor details.\nThe authorities in St. Lucia do inspect boats for clearance from time to time.\nNote:St Lucia introduced their Online Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) Card System to replace the paper arrival / departure cards that travelers file when clearing in and out. The system became mandatory on 12 April 2023 for air travelers and cruisers are encouraged to use the system as well. For more information see thisSt. Lucia Government webpageand theSt. Lucia Online Customs and Immigration Portal. (This is the same system noted above in the Pre-Arrival Procedures –https://travelslu.govt.lc/.)\nOnce clearance has been granted yachts are free to moor/anchor anywhere on the island. Soufriere, however, does charge a mooring permit fee, mooring fees plus park entry fees. SeeFeesfor details.\nSt. Lucia Departure Procedures for Yachts\nIf staying less than three days, vessels can clear in and out with Customs on arrival.\nAfter clearing out, yachts have 72 hours to depart St. Lucia, or 24 hours if local or charter boats.\nYachts must, however, clear out with Immigration as passports need to be stamped on departure day. A new crew list must be submitted if there have been any crew changes.\nDuty-free fuel may be purchased after clearing out. This can be done at Rodney Bay Marina where one can go directly to the fuel dock after clearing Customs, or at Capella Marina, Marigot Bay.\nWarning:Daytime burglaries have occurred in Vieux Fort while skippers travel to the airport to deal with Immigration.

This form must be presented to Customs on arrival at Scarborough or Charlotteville. The same procedure is necessary for the reverse voyage to Trinidad from Tobago, with clearance from Scarborough. Make sure your paperwork is all in order before moving between the two islands as penalties for incorrect paperwork can be harsh.\nWith permission from the Customs officer in Trinidad, you can anchor elsewhere in Tobago, such as Store Bay, and go overland to Scarborough to complete the necessary formalities.\nNote that Tobago is divided into 2 parts. Charlotteville has jurisdiction over the northern part of Tobago (from Castara Bay to Prince’s Bay) and Scarborough the rest of the island. If you wish to visit the bays in the north, you must clear out of Scarborough and sail to Charlotteville, clear in there and get a permit for the bays in their jurisdiction.\nSeeScarboroughandCharlottevillefor more information.\nOn clearing out domestically, you have 24 hours to depart.\nYachts must clear out with Customs, Immigration and Port Authority and notify them of your next Port of Call.\nThere is a navigation fee to pay on departure to the Harbour Master based on how long you have been in Trinidad waters. Plus a departure tax if more than 2 crew on board. SeeFeesfor details.\nImmigration gives you four hours to depart Trinidad waters.

See thisBBC report.\nThe SOE was initially extended by Parliament for three months on January 13th, 2025. This three-month extension would have ended around April 13th, 2025.  Recent travel advisories, updated after this period, no longer mention an active State of Emergency. For example, the U.S. Embassy in Trinidad & Tobago updated its security alert to reflect the end of the SOE on April 13th, 2025.  While the State of Emergency has ended, it’s important to note that concerns about crime, including violent crime and gang activity, remain in Trinidad and Tobago. Travel advisories from various countries still recommend exercising a high degree of caution.\nBased on reports to Noonsite from cruisers, petty theft is on the rise in the Caribbean in general. Cruisers should take basic safety precautions and use common sense when ashore. Avoid walking alone in isolated areas, especially at night.

While there were many crime reports in the past, a concerted effort by the cruising and business communities joining forces with the police and marine authorities has improved the security situation for yachts considerably and shows what can happen when the authorities do not ignore what is happening in the cruising community.\nSecurity patrols are in place locally, however, petty theft does still occur.\nThere always seems to be a rise in crime (in general) over the carnival season (February).\nDinghy thieves operate throughout the Caribbean. Be sure to lift, chain, and lock your dinghy and outboard when not in use, especially at night. When leaving your dinghy ashore, ensure that your dinghy and outboard are securely locked.\nAirTags and other cell based/Bluetooth tracking devices are being used by cruisers to track their dinghys/outboards. Some thieves are aware of this practice and may detect, locate and disable them. Understand the limitations of using tracking devices. (See thisMay 2024 Jost Van Dyke, BVI CSSN report.) The use of GPS trackers (rather than Bluetooth trackers) is recommended. See thisReport by David Lyman.\nA new method of corruption appearing in Caribbean islands is for a “finders” fee to be demanded when a stolen dinghy is “found”. (See thisNov 2023 Tyrell Bay, Carriacou CSSN reportand thisApr 2024 Clifton Harbour, SVG CSSN report.)\nDinghies and outboards are the main target for thieves, particularly in the Chaguaramas anchorage.  Do not leave your dinghy in the water, even if it is cable locked.  Thieves are known to cut through both rope painters and cables.\nIn August 2023, CSSN received three separate reports about a fisherman approaching yachts in the Scotland Bay and Chaguaramas area of Trinidad, offering to sell fish. When invited aboard he assaulted and stole from the crew.\nSince 2021, most reported incidents are concerning dinghy and outboard theft.\nCatastrophic oil spill off Tobago February 7th, 2024.\nThe Caribbean Safety and Security Net (CSSN)collects and shares reliable reports of crimes against yachts in the Caribbean, helping cruisers make informed decisions.\nTheCSSN websiteoffers current and past incident reports, stats, regional piracy info, and annual summaries.

Seethis news reportfor more details. Even if taking part in a convoy, a float plan should still be submitted. The TTCG remains responsive to yachts and has coordinated assistance for vessels in distress.\nAn increased Coast Guard presence and visibility has given cruisers reassurance that officials are serious about security for visiting yachts.\nThe most important requirement for any boats heading to Trinidad and Tobago is to file aFloat Planto the Trinidad & Tobago Coastguard prior to arrival. See theClearance sectionfor full details. Even if sailing with other boats, a float plan should still be submitted.\nThis Report –Trinidad and Tobago:  Update on Security and Safety Issues–  dated 2022, is a useful read if you are considering heading to these islands.\nYachts had previously been able to join a convoy for safety and security, but there have been no formal convoys for several years.\nGrenada VHF Channel 66 Repeaterwas privately donated to the Grenadian Government and is used by the Grenada Cruisers Net to provide coverage to all Grenadian waters.

SeeClearancefor details.Pre-Arrival Crew:Most nationals do not require a visa.

Canada’s capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas areToronto, Montreal, andVancouver.\nCanada has a total population of over 37 million consisting of Arctic indigenous people and Francophone Quebeckers to the British expats and burgeoning Asian community. English and French are the official languages in Canada.\nThe Canadian dollar (CAD) is the official currency of Canada.\nCanada is divided into six time zones. Most of Canada operates on standard time from the first Sunday in November to the second Sunday in March and daylight saving time the rest of the year.\nCanada has cruising grounds on both the western Pacific coast and the eastern Atlantic coast. The majority of Canadians, however, sail inland on the Great Lakes, which can be reached either by sailing up the St Lawrence river from the Atlantic or through the Erie Canal. Some like to make the round trip by sailing to Nova Scotia, up St Lawrence to the Lakes and then back to New York and the US east coast through the Canal.\nMore often visited by foreign yachts is Nova Scotia, the first stop down-east from Maine. Halifax, the main harbour, is a large yachting centre and, like St Johns in Newfoundland, a transatlantic springboard and landfall.\nOn the Pacific coast, British Columbia boasts one of the most beautiful and dramatic cruising grounds in the world with its snowcapped mountains, waterfalls cascading down rugged cliffs, a myriad of islands and quiet, still fjords. The 282 mile (454 km) long Vancouver Island protects most of the mainland from the Pacific Ocean and so creates an inland sea. The most popular cruising area is the Gulf Islands in the south. Another good cruising area is at the north of the Strait of Georgia, where a cluster of islands borders the magnificent Desolation Sound. North of this begins the inside passage to Alaska.\nA large tidal range and strong currents make for attentive navigation along this coast, as do the hazards of floating logs and kelp. All of the areas is well charted and tide rips are marked. Fog can be a hazard and radar a great boon, especially as there is a lot of other traffic – logging tugs, fishing boats, fast ferries to and from the islands and, especially near Vancouver, commercial shipping. The rewards of nature, both in scenery and wildlife, including superb fishing, more than make up for the attentive navigation needed.\nUntil 2009, the Arctic pack ice made the Northwest Passage unnavigable throughout most of the year. However, climate change has reduced the pack ice, and this Arctic shrinkage has made the waterways more navigable.\nThere are good facilities in all major yachting centers. On the west coast there is Vancouver for both repairs and marinas, Nanaimo on Vancouver Island for provisioning and Prince Rupert for general services. On the Atlantic coast, Halifax, in Nova Scotia, has a wide range of repair facilities and mooring options, although Lunenburg offers the best options.

Generally speaking, officialdom on the Pacific side has been extremely easy to get along with, especially since they did away with having to clear from one domestic port to the other. However, be prepared for time-consuming and frustrating clearance procedures on the Caribbean side of Mexico. In the major ports, there are maritime agents who will do the formalities for a fee, as will some of the marinas. While this may appear expensive, in ports that are notoriously difficult (Islas Mujeresbeing one), it will save a great deal of time and alot of headaches.Cruiser comments on Cozumelstate that in December 2024 an agent is now required to clear in, the fees were costly and if you need a Temporary Import Permit, you (or the agent) will need to travel to Cancun to secure one.\nIt is strongly advised that ALL foreign boats visiting the EAST coast of Mexico (including those from the USA) arrive with a zarpe from their last port of call. Islas Mujeres, the most common port of entry on this coast, make a big deal out of having a zarpe. This is rarely a problem on the WEST coast. See details about this requirement and other documents needed inMexico Documents.\nEach crew member will need to fill out an entry permit, called an FMM [Forma Migratoria Multiple]. This can now be processed prior to your arrival in Mexico by using theNational Immigration Institute (INM) portal. Here you can complete passport and vessel details and pay your immigration fee. SeeFeesfor current charges.\nSee page 4 of theVisiting Mexico by Private Boat, from the Mexico Marina Association (2025), for a comprehensive look at the below steps required to complete the FMM process:\nComplete the INM process on the INM web portal (this includes payment).Complete a spreadsheet with vessel and passenger information and email it to INM.E-mail the spreadsheet and payment receipt to the local immigration office where you intend to land.

Print a copy of the receipt and electronic manifest, and present to Mexican Navy if inspected.\nA TIP (Importada, or referred to by some as a cruising permit) is required for all vessels larger than 4.5m (15ft) when in Mexico. This can be applied for in advance if you are a US/Canadian or Mexican boat. All other nationalities must get the TIP at the first port of entry.\nRemember to cancel your boat’s TIP before you sell the boat. Canceling old/expired TIPs has proven expensive, time consuming or sometimes outright impossible. See our article aboutThe Importance of Cancelling TIPs in Mexicofor more information and advice.

If documents are not properly stamped, they will not be accepted by the subsequent authority and you will have to go back and start the process all over again.\nHealth Inspection (Sanitation):\nThe doctor will ask the crew health-related questions, take body temperatures, ask about vaccinations and do possible further tests depending on which port you came from (Haiti, for example, will demand more scrutiny). After completing the interview, the doctor will stamp all the necessary documents, ask for a fee and give you a Health Permit for cruising Mexican waters.\nThe stamped documents from the DoctorRegistration of the vesselCopies of the passports of crew travelling on boardBoat InsuranceZarpe from last port of callCaptain’s license\nCopies of the passports of crew travelling on board\nSeeImmigrationfor additional details.\nThe Agriculture officer may be seen before or after Customs and is not obligatory in every port.

The Port Authority (API) will calculate a fee based on tonnage and it’s likely you will have to make this payment at a local bank in cash. Return with your receipt and you will be given your cruising permit. You can now proceed to get a TIP if required.\nIn some ports you must pay a Port Use Fee when arriving and anchoring (if you anchor out). These fees are paid to the API (Port Administration).\nNote:Cruisers warn (2022) that domestic clearance in Zihuatenejo, on the Pacific side of MX, is lengthy and there are fees paid. This is very different from other domestic ports where most port captains are efficient, fast and domestic clearance is a free process.\nA minimum of eight hours notice of departure is required by law. You will need six more copies of the crew list and must visit Immigration and the Port Captains Office.\n1. Go to the Immigration office to get the crew list stamped and surrender the FMM forms. If you have lost your FMM form, you will be charged again.2. Go to the Port Captain’s office to pay the Vessel’s Check-out fees and have the crew list stamped with the authorization to exit the country of Mexico. They will issue you with a Zarpe.\nAlthough this document may not be requested when clearing into the next country (note: Hawaii require an exit zarpe from Mexico), it is necessary to have it in the event of being stopped by a Mexican Navy boat while still in Mexican waters. If wishing to stop anywhere in Mexico after clearing out, this should be put on the outward clearance by the relevant official.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

However, in practice many port authorities in Panama operate differently from each other and cruisers may well find they obtain different clearance conditions to those stated. See the adjacent reports and news for the latest information from cruisers.\nThere is a law requiring the pre-registration of visiting vessels. Details about the yacht and its crew are to be sent to the Authorities (AMP) at least 48 hours before arrival at any Panamanian port. This information may be sent by email or by filling in the online form. The online form is available atAMP website.\nIf you contact the Port Captain/Marina prior to your arrival, it’s likely they will request all documentation electronically to speed up the arrival process.\nAll yachts over 65ft must have AIS so that their arrival time in Panama waters can be recorded on the system.\nYachts headed to Panama with a Zarpe should list a specific port as a destination, Panama alone is not a port; Panama City, Colon, Portobelo or a marina or yacht club are all acceptable options. For more information seethis clearance procedures report.\nSan Blas ports of entry, after a period of disruption, are now open once again (July 2025).\nFormalities with the Panamanian Authorities (clearing in and out, immigration, etc.) are separate from formalities with the Panama Canal Authority for a canal transit. Full details about the Panama Canal Transit, including fees, can be found in theprocedures for a handline transit of the Panama Canal.\nArriving yachts have up to 72 hours after arrival in Panama waters to clear in first with Immigration and then with the Port Captain. Be sure to check-in with all authorities as soon as you land in Panama and not later than 72 hours.\nAny foreign person who enters the country violating immigration checkpoints at land, air or sea will be fined between $1,000 and $5,000, depending on the severity of the violation committed.See news.\nSeethis warning if clearing in at Porvenirin the San Blas Islands, where Immigration clearance can be confusing.\nWhile it has become common practice to stop and visit the San Blas or Secas Islands, any long delay in transit time will be noticed. Cruisers have reported fines of US$1000 each for not checking in immediately.\nClearance is typically completed ashore at the respective offices. When the captain goes ashore to complete clearance procedures, all others must remain on board until clearance is complete.\nNote that in both Balboa and Cristobal (Colon), arriving yachts may be boarded by Panamanian officials. At Cristobal, they may complete all the initial clearance formalities. Cruisers report that the Cristobal Authorities are by far the most strict and “by the book” in all of Panama.\nPort Captain’s Office:To obtain a “Autoridad Marítima Declaración General”. This is the first paperwork sailors must do upon arrival at entry points in Panama and is issued by the on call Port Captain. You will need to surrender the original International Zarpe from your previous port of call and provide copies of your crew list, crew passports, and vessel documentation.Immigration Office:Once the yacht has been checked in, all crew must proceed to immigration to obtain a tourist visa (and be fingerprinted). Be aware that some offices (Linton, Balboa Yacht Club, and Flamenco Island) are considered branch offices and only provide 72 hour entry visas. You will need to follow-up with the main office for a 90-180 day tourist visa. SeeImmigrationfor more details.AMP/Port Captain:Finally skippers must make an official request for a Cruising permit. This is not required if going through the canal only, however, if staying in Panama more than 14 days one must be obtained from the main office of AMP in Panama City. This can either be obtained by visiting the office yourself, or, from another port of entry via the Port Captain or an agent (for an additional fee). Shelter Bay Marina offer this service. Outside of Panama City this could take anything between 1-2 weeks to obtain, depending on where you are.

SeeDocumentsfor further details.\nYachts arriving from the Caribbean/South America:\nVessels entering or leaving Panama on the Caribbean side can do so inPuerto Lindo,ColonorPortobelo. However, in both Linton and Portobelo it’s not possible to get a cruising permit so  you will need to go to Colon to get one – and – if you check in at Puerto Lindo you will need to go to Portobelo to get your visa from Immigration (short bus ride).\nIt is possible to check in with Immigration at offices atPuerto Obaldia, at the far eastern end ofGuna Yala(San Blas) orPorvenir(now called Gaigirgordub) at the western end.  However from Gaigirgordub, you will then need to go to Colon within 72 hours to get your cruising permit.\nIf arriving in the Guna Yala first, it is not advisable to take the SUVs from Carti in Guna Yala to Panama City or to Colon to clear in, as you will pass through police checkpoints who will give you a hefty fine (or even arrest you) if you have not already visited an immigration office and had your passport stamped.\nIt is recommended to have the Guna Yala listed on your exit zarpe from your previous port (e.g. Colon via Guna Yala).\nYachts arriving from the Pacific:\nFlamenco Signal Station should be contacted on VHF Channels 12 or 16 when moving across or through the marked canal channel. Flamenco Signal may or may not respond.\nVisit the branch Immigration offices at eitherBalboa Yacht Clubor Flamenco Island (on the second floor of the building which houses the Duty-Free Store) for the 72-hour entry visa (*see below for more info). You will need to also provide copies of your International Zarpe, crew list, and passports. Plan to follow-up with the appropriate immigration office for the tourist visa\nGo to the Port Captain’s office on Flamenco Island (also above the Duty-Free Store) to obtain a “Declaration General” and your Cruising Permit. You will need to surrender the original International Zarpe from your previous port of call and provide copies of the crew list, crew passports, and vessel documentation.\nWhen sailing from one district to another in Panama (e.g. San Blas to Colon or Colon to Balboa – via the Canal – etc.) it is no longer necessary to clear in and out between Panamanian ports; your Cruising Permit (Permiso de Navegacion) allows you to move freely for one year. In reality, Port Captains are still being trained and clearing in and out may be requested. It is recommended you have enough copies of your documentation on board (check in declaration, cruising permit, crew list and passport copies) in case the Authorities want to  board the yacht.\nPort Captain Office:Take your original Cruising Permit, with a crew list and copies of crew passports. Here you will pay for your international Zarpe.\nImmigration Office:Have your passports stamped for the exit. Immigration will require a copy of all passports, the crew list, and Zarpe.\nAn agent will be able to deal with the Port Captain requirements by e-mail/WhatsApp if you are clearing out of a port that only has an Immigration office (e.g. San Carlos or El Porvenir).\nOfficially, the day you check out of Panama for another country is the day you should depart. It is, however, a common practice for boats on the Pacific side of Panama for example, to stop in Las Perlas for a day or two on their way westward with no problems reported to date. Boarding by officials is rare but you may incur a fine of up to $500 if you linger and are boarded.\nNote: Should there be adverse sea conditions on the day of your departure, the Autoridad Maritima de Panama may issue a maritime warning and not issue zarpes to boats wishing to depart that day.\nDetails of all charges can be found under “Fees” below.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

Be sure to lift, chain, and lock your dinghy and outboard when not in use, especially at night. When leaving your dinghy ashore, ensure that your dinghy and outboard are securely locked.\nAirTags and other cell based/Bluetooth tracking devices are being used by cruisers to track their dinghys/outboards. Some thieves are aware of this practice and may detect, locate and disable them. Understand the limitations of using tracking devices. (See thisMay 2024 Jost Van Dyke, BVI CSSN report.) The use of GPS trackers (rather than Bluetooth trackers) is recommended. See thisReport by David Lyman.\nA new method of corruption appearing in Caribbean islands is for a “finders” fee to be demanded when a stolen dinghy is “found”. (See thisNov 2023 Tyrell Bay, Carriacou CSSN reportand thisApr 2024 Clifton Harbour, SVG CSSN report.)\nMost incidents of theft are petty or opportunistic, but several serious robberies/attacks have been reported in anchorages around Panama, at Linton Bay Marina and in the Las Perlas Archipelago where two separate incidents of armed assault and robbery occurred near San Miguel.\nDinghy and outboard motors continue to be the most popular targets for thieves.  Even chain-locked dinghies are not safe any more as thieves are coming prepared to cut chains and painters, so do not leave your dinghy in the water, even if it has been chain locked.  Even if you lift your dinghy, ensure that it and the outboard are locked.\nThieves were active in Bocas del Toro in the Bocas marina anchorage according to reports provided to CSSN.  One incident was reported in December 2024 but there were several other incidents around the same time but no reports were made.\nNowherein Panama (including Guna Yala) should yachtsanchor at night in remote areas without being accompanied by other yachts. Always lock up at night and arrange to have your boat cared for if you will be away.\nAttacks against yachts in Bahia Nombre de Dios in 2019 were widely reported. Six individuals were arrested. The tourism ministry coordinated a program to make the communities in the area aware of the damage these attacks cause. The authorities, Panama Marina Managers and the Aeronaval have a presence in Shelter Bay Marina, Portobelo, Panamarina, Puerto Lindo, Isla Grande and Turtle Cay Marina.

{"id": "usa_main", "country": "USA", "section_type": "main", "url": "https://www.noonsite.com/place/usa/", "content": "Whilst in the past, the majority of foreign boats visiting the United States were Canadian, security and reporting requirements have been simplified in recent years making the USA a much more accessible place to visit.\nThe USA has a lot to offer the cruising sailor, particularly the East Coast, the entire length of which can be cruised from the Florida Keys to Maine. A cruise along this coast has the added attraction of theIntracoastal Waterway (ICW),a unique system of canals, rivers and estuaries, which stretches along most of the eastern seaboard offering the chance of sailing up or down the coast in sheltered waters almost within sight of the ocean.\nOffering less variety, the West Coast’s main attractions are concentrated at its two extremes. The most popular cruising area in the Pacific Northwest is the San Juan Islands, an archipelago of some 200 islands, many of which have been declared wildlife reserves or marine parks. Beyond these islands and through Canadian waters, the Inside Passage beckons, linking Puget Sound to Alaska, America’s ultimate cruising destination. An increasing number of yachts sail to Alaska for the short summer season, either by taking the inside route or making an offshore detour by stopping first at the Hawaiian Islands.\nVisibility is often poor in the Pacific Northwest region, so radar is useful. The Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) on VHF Channel 14 provides a useful service in the Juan de Fuca Strait which is often fogbound and always very busy with traffic.\nFor those avoiding high latitude cruising, there is all year round sailing in the Pacific Southwest, whether in the San Francisco Bay area or the Channel Islands, off Southern California. Of the eight main islands, Santa Catalina is the best known and most popular. The other islands are less frequented and there are countless coves around their precipitous shores. Since some of the Channel Islands are either privately owned or part of the National Park system, a permit to visit them must be obtained in advance by those wishing to go ashore.\nYachting facilities throughout the United States are predominantly of a high standard, especially near larger cities. There are marinas practically everywhere and the only objection visiting sailors might have are the high docking fees. Fortunately almost everywhere there is also a place to anchor at little or no cost and in some ports municipal marinas, docks or moorings are priced at a level affordable by those cruising on a restricted budget.\nOn the East Coast, the most important yachting centers where the whole range of repair facilities are available are the areas around the following cities: Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Beaufort/Morehead City, Baltimore, City Island (New York), Newport, Marblehead. On the West Coast: San Diego, Newport Beach, San Francisco, Seattle. In between these places, there are countless smaller ports, where one can find boatyards, chandleries and all kinds of workshops.\nThe USA utilizes a different set of VHF frequencies for some communications. Most VHF radio sets have a “USA mode” in order to switch automatically to these frequencies. Whilst VHF Channel 16 is the internationally recognized hailing and emergency channel, it is common for some marinas to use alternate “Alpha Channels” to communicate on working channels. Most importantly, the US Coast Guard commonly uses VHF Channel 22A as a working channel. When operating in US territorial waters, it is advised to switch your VHF radio set to “USA mode.” Also, VHF Channel 09 is regularly used as a reserved channel for official activities such as bridge and lock operation.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

An ESTA does not apply if entering the USA for the first time by yacht, however, entry by commercial carrier, or foot first with an ESTA to obtain a visa waiver, and then subsequently entering by yacht, is a valid form of entry for short visits.\nAs of 09 June, 2025, travel bans have been introduced for citizens of some countries.See Immigration for more details.\nThe US Coast Guard has the authority to board any vessel within US territorial waters and they frequently do this, particularly off the coast of Florida. The US Coast Guard also patrols the Bahamas and parts of the Caribbean as a joint patrol with local officials. The US Navy or Coast Guard can also board any US flag vessel anywhere in the world. All vessels entering the 12-mile territorial waters must fly the Q flag until clearance procedures have been conducted.\nNOTE: A US Coast Guard boarding or customs inspection offshore does NOT constitute a customs clearance procedure.\nAll ports of entry can be found on theCBP website, with phone numbers. Also view them on Noonsite by clicking on the “Explore USA” button and then “Main Ports”.\nBear in mind that while foreign yachts can check into USA via the ROAM reporting App (see more details below), their crew cannot and a face-to-face procedure with CBP is mandatory for official Immigration clearance. This may be in the form of a video-chat, or more likely – if you and your crew are holding visas – a visit to a CBP office to complete a biographic entry will be required. So choose your port of entry carefully, depending on your circumstances, so you have easy access to a CBP office if required.\nIt also may be that your are not able to clear in using the App. Be aware that the nearest CBP reporting office might be some distance away from your chosen port of entry, requiring a taxi. No taxi in the USA will accept foreign currency. You may not be allowed to rent a car until you have an entry stamp in your passport. It would be worthwhile to select an entry port where a CBP office is within a short distance.\nFind CBP reporting office locations.\nCustoms & Border Protection (CBP)\nThe introduction of the new CBP ROAM App in 2018 has made clearing in face-to-face with a CBP officer a much simpler and quicker process, as it allows boaters to present themselves using Video Chat. Obtaining clearance can be as simple as creating and submitting an arrival request via ROAM, getting a call back from CBP, answering a few questions and then being granted clearance (although an “in-person” visit to a CBP office may be requested).\nForeign boats can now obtain their cruising licenses digitally via ROAM (12 months will be granted).See this very useful demonstration videoshowing the exact procedure to follow when using ROAM.\nUS boats over 30 feet in length will need a DTOPS decal number to complete their vessel profile on ROAM.

Report to Port of Entry in person\nIf unable to use ROAM to complete clearance, or if directed by CBP, boaters must report their arrival at the nearest CBP office/reporting station within 24 hours of arrival.\nThe central number to call is 1-800-432-1216, alternatively all reporting locations can be found on theCBP website, with phone numbers.\nCBP reporting locationsare staffed during boating season for pleasure boats to report their arrival and be inspected by CBP. Cruisers recommend not arriving in the US on Fri/Sat/Sun as CBP phone lines tend to be constantly engaged. The skipper may go ashore to make a phone call from a landline in a marina, but no other member of the boat’s crew is permitted off the dock until clearance procedures are conducted. If arriving after working hours, contact the CBP immediately, but face-to-face inspection may not be possible until the following morning. During this time, you must remain on board and conduct clearance procedures immediately the next morning. You must report your arrival no matter what time of day.\nIf physically checking in at a CBP reporting office, foreign-flagged vessels will have tofile a CBP-1300 (Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement)within 48 hours and pay the applicable fees. At that time, the master of the vessel may apply for a cruising license (see domestic cruising below). There are heavy fines if this is not submitted within 48 hours of arrival. CBP will ask you if you have brought food into the country, will inspect all passports and will likely issue you a cruising license for one year (12 months).\nAll US yachts must report any merchandise to CBP that has been acquired abroad and is subject to duty.\nImmigration clearance begins with the CBP ROAM App, however, every visa holder must reportin personon arrival in the US to a CBP Officer to complete their biographic entry. See theImmigration sectionfor further details and visa requirements.\nFor paperwork required seeDocuments.\nCBP offices will not schedule a clear-in interview (if required) without either a preliminary clearance through the CBP ROAM app or by calling 1-800-432-1216. The CBP ROAM app is strongly preferred and the recommended method.ROAM will only work when you are actually inside US waters.CBP Ports of Entry & Contact Numbers.If a member of a Frequent Passage Scheme ( LBO), call +1 (800) 432-1216 or +1 (800) 451-0393. Both of these numbers are toll-free automated systems and may not connect properly with foreign SIM cards. Wait times may be lengthy. These schemes are NOT designed for first-time arrivals. For more information on Frequent Passage Schemes, see the bottom of this Clearance section.Failure to follow the correct procedures on arrival (particularly in reference to reporting arrival in a timely manner, or disembarking your vessel without permission) can lead to a substantial fine and seizure of the offending vessel.For questions or inquiries concerning arrival into the USA contact the NVMC 24/7 line at 1-800-708-9823 or 1-304-264-2502 or send an email to sans@nvmc.uscg.gov\nCBP offices will not schedule a clear-in interview (if required) without either a preliminary clearance through the CBP ROAM app or by calling 1-800-432-1216.

If the cruising license is uploaded into ROAM, this can be done quickly and efficiently using the app. This includes Canadian boats.\nIt’s also possible to call the appropriate CBP office to inform them of your arrival in a domestic port (numbersat this link), if unable to use ROAM.\nIt is important to note that a Cruising License/Permit is only issued to vessels coming from a foreign port. USVI and Puerto Rico are not classed as foreign ports, they are classed as domestic ports. If coming from either of these 2 places, either get a License/Permit in Puerto Rico, or be sure to clear into and out of a foreign port (such as the Bahamas) prior to your arrival in the USA.\nA U.S. pleasure craft and a foreign-flag vessel without a Cruising License (30 feet or longer in length) must pay an annual decal user fee of $34.83. User Fee Decals may be purchased online through theDecal Transponder Online Procurement System DTOPS. These craft are also required to notify Customs (Homeland Security) when moving from one customs region to another, (i.e., from Ft Lauderdale to Miami). There are fines for vessels who do not comply. Often, vessels who report a few times will be deemed “secure” and will be instructed by the CBP official that further reporting is unnecessary until departure from the USA. See theNoonsite/USA reportingarticle for more information.\nOne thing to be aware of is that the various states often interpret these federal regulations differently, or apply local rules to suit a local situation. If possible, contact the officials at your chosen Port of Entry in advance to check requirements. CBP officers are normally very helpful and will notify you of any updated laws or procedures.\nIf is not necessary to clear out of the USA. A call to the local CBP office to inform them you are leaving the country is sufficient. CBP offices and contact numbers can be foundat this link.\nMore and more countries in the Caribbean and worldwide are wanting to see clearance papers (exit zarpe) from the last port and will prohibit entry if you don’t have them. You can find out if this is a requirement in your destination country by reading the clearance information on Noonsite.\nTo obtain an exit zarpe from the USA is a complicated process as officially, foreign pleasure craft do not need to clear out of the country. If you need a zarpe, complete the CBP Form 1300 [the form can be obtained here] and take it with your boat documents and crew passports to a CBP office at a port or airport. Call ahead for an appointment. You will need to get this form stamped.\nSome cruisers have encountered confusion from the Customs officers when getting a stamp on this form by pleasure yachts as it is typically for commercial vessels (they do not have a dedicated form for non-commercial vessels).  Call up your local CBP office and enquire before traveling to get your form stamped.  Some cruisers have reported using a notary to sign the form and say this works very well.\nThis CBP Form 1300 procedure is common (and important to follow) especially when departing Puerto Rico or the USVI when the next port of call is the Dominican Republic, the BVI, or any of the Windward Islands.\nForeign flagged vessels not should have a problem travelling between Cuba and the US, although yachts returning to the United States from Cuba may be boarded.\nWhilst Key West has a history of not particularly welcoming cruisers who arrive directly from Cuba, US flagged or otherwise, the situation appears to be improving and this should no longer be treated as a port to avoid when clearing into the States after a visit to Cuba.\nPalm Beach and Fort Lauderdale have always been good choices for clearing into the States after a visit to Cuba, but you must stay offshore and may not use the ICW until clearance has been obtained.\nAnother option to avoid any problems is to leave Cuba for another country (such as the Bahamas) and make entry into the United States from there.\nNEXUS is a joint US/Canadian customs and immigration program for frequent travellers between the two countries which simplifies border formalities for Canadian and US citizens. NEXUS is designed to simplify procedures for pre-approved, low-risk boaters who regularly cross the border. It allows such boaters to clear Customs and Immigration of either Canada or the U.S.A. by contacting the Telephone Reporting Centre (TRC) within 30 minutes and up to 4 hours prior to arrival, and is valid for 5 years. See theNexus Program websitefor details.\nFor infrequent visits, the I-68 allows boaters to enter the USA from Canada for recreational purposes, with only the need to telephone CBP on arrival. SeeCanadian Border Boat Landing (I-68) Programfor more details.\nForeign boats moving from Canada to the USA, can make use of the visa-waiver scheme, by traveling across the border by foot first before entering by yacht.See Immigration for more details.\nOther Frequent Passage Schemes:\nThe Local Boater Option (LBO) is a similar scheme operating in Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, which allows pleasure boat reporting by telephone.

While these extreme acts of violence make the international news, the reality is that violent crime, especially gun-related crime, and especially violent crime against a tourist is rare. More than 75 million international visitors arrive in the USA each year and reported crimes against visitors are far less frequent than crimes against locals. There is no statistical indication that tourists from any country are specifically targeted.\nThe most frequent crime against visitors to the USA is petty theft. This includes pickpocketing.\nThere is an increased chance of crime in some downtown areas of major cities, particularly late at night. If you are visiting or travelling through a downtown area late at night, it is common to take a taxi even for short rides to ensure safety.\nA risk for visiting yachts is robbery of unsecured property. Many downtown areas have municipal docks that may be unsecured.\nALWAYS LOCK YOUR YACHTand secure all large windows or hatches when leaving for any length of time.

It shares borders with Montenegro and Kosovo to the north and northeast, Macedonia to the east and Greece to the south. Tirana is the capital and largest city of Albania.\nAlbania has now opened its doors to foreign tourists and the number of visiting cruising yachts is steadily increasing. Whilst the welcome may be warm, visiting yachts can still be treated with some suspicion by officials.\nThe population is approximately 3.2 million inhabitants.\nThe official language is Albanian, recognized for its two distinct dialects, “Gheg” and “Tosk”. The Shkumbin River, which divides the country into two almost equal parts, is the natural border of these two dialects.Ghegis spoken in the north, whileToskis spoken in the south.\nThe monetary unit of the Republic of Albania is the “Lek”.\nIn Albania, the standard time is Central European Time (CET; UTC+01:00).\nAlbania has a Mediterranean climate with each season offering distinct, yet pleasant weather. Some features of the climate vary by region. On average, Albanians enjoy a great deal of sunshine, second only to Spain (in Europe) in average annual sunny days.\nThe main ports of entry, Durres, Vlore and Saranda (Sarandë)are all commercial ports with few or no facilities for visiting yachts. There is a new, basic marina at Orikum, near Vlore, a marina under constructions in Vlore port and a marina planned for Durres.\nAlbania doesn’t have a huge coastline – 155NMs – and it is exposed to any south or west winds, so cruisers should keep an eye on wind and swell conditions.\nIn southern Albania, apart from the marina in Vlore, there are only poorly protected anchorages. During the Summer these are popular with day-tripper party boats.\nCruising along the coast offers possibilities, although permission to do so must be obtained when clearing in. One of the main attractions inland is the remarkably well preserved Greek and Roman ruins at Butrint, which is best reached from Saranda. The capital Tirana is 38.6 kms (24 miles) inland from the port of Durres.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

Officials do not board the vessel any more. Vlore and Durres are the only ports with marinas at this time.

The new procedures and tariff have been applied to all Egyptian ports and marinas with the exception of  the Suez Canal, so far. It is Noonsite’s recommendation to appoint an agent well in advance of your arrival, who can correctly guide you as to which port is the cheapest to check-into and out of Egypt and to avoid paying excessively high fees.\nNoonsite does not recommend any particular agent, however, there is a list of Clearance agentsherethat are regularly used by cruising boats. It can be useful to look atreports from cruisersfor their various experiences with agents and cruisers comments under the “Explore Country” tab.\nIt is highly likely you will need an agent at every major port (many are stipulating this now). For example inPort Ghalibthere are two licensed agents as approved by the Egyptian Maritime Transport Sector and it is mandatory that all yachts use one of these agents for clearance. Authorities don’t usually speak English and will only deal with the agents they know.\nSend your agent clearance documents 72hrs prior to arrival (Registry Certificate, Crew List, Last Port Clearance, Photo of Passport, etc.) and e-mail the marina in advance to alert them of your arrival including ETA, Yacht details, Period of stay, diesel if you need it, Registration Certificate, Crew List, Last Port Clearance, Last 10 Ports of call, and Period of stay.\nFind out if you need a visa to enter Egypt.See Immigrationfor more details.\nIf you simply are transiting through Egypt via the Suez Canal and don’t intend to go ashore, you don’t need to check-into the country.\nDetailed Suez Canal transit notes, regulations and fees payable are exclusively available to Noonsite Members, via the green special offers bar.\nBasic transit costs are outlined inEgypt Fees.\nThe majority of yachts coming from the south check into Egypt atPort Ghalib MarinaorHurghada Port. Port Ghalib currently has incredibly high fees, as does Hurghada. Agents recommend that based on the government’s new tariff, the best/cheapest port for check-in/out isSuez, at this time, as the new government bill has not yet been applied to the Suez Canal marinas. SeeFeesfor more details.\nIf sheltering from strong winds or making an overnight stop, yachts are normally allowed to stay in Egyptian waters before clearing in at an official port of entry. If coming from the Red Sea and intending to stop in Egypt before clearing in, it is advisable to have obtained a visa in advance. It is also advisable not to actually go ashore until officially cleared in.\nTo see a list of the best recommended (and permitted) stopovers on the way to Port Suez –go to Restrictions.\nYour agent will usually be in contact from the moment you enter Egypt’s territorial waters to provide the necessary support and give the  exact position for the most appropriate non-prohibited places for anchoring in case of an emergency.\nYachts coming from the north normally check in atPort Said. Port Clearance fees here are more reasonable, however it is not a good port to remain in, as the swell is very bad.\nIn ports of entry, clearance must be done withCustomsandImmigration. SeeDocumentsfor detail on what paperwork is required. Expect clearance to take most of the day. Customs will want to board the boat.All Government fees are payable via the marina at the port of entry – then there are some additional fees to be paid separately at Immigration etc. SeeFeesfor more details.The Coast Guard normally maintain a presence in all ports and anchorages, and usually visit the yacht, requesting details of the yacht and its crew.\nIn ports of entry, clearance must be done withCustomsandImmigration.

If you want to go ashore you must clear in at a port of entry, and then IN and OUT of every port afterwards. This is prohibitively expensive and well beyond the financial means of most cruisers. If you wish to explore Egypt, the most reasonable and safest option for your boat is to clear into the country at Ismailia, berth the boat at the newly renovated marina and explore inland from there. Stopping at anchorages to seek refuge from contrary winds is permitted, but you cannot go ashore.\nIf transiting the Suez Canal and not stopping anywhere else after the transit, the outward clearance can be obtained while doing the transit formalities. Yachts may then proceed to sea as soon as they have dropped the pilot.\nOnce outward clearance is obtained, yachts must leave within 24 hours, or obtain another clearance.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

See Weather for more details.With such a varied coastline, France has more variety to offer the cruising sailor than any other European country, from the tidal creeks and shallow estuaries of Brittany to the chic ports of the Côte d’Azur and the stark beauty of the island of Corsica. For the visiting sailor, each side of France has its special attractions:On the northern coast, facilities are best at St Malo, Ouistreham (near Caen) Le Havre, and Cherbourg.The Atlantic coast calls for more attentive navigation, but brings its rewards in the many natural harbors and inlets. Although spectacular, this coast can be dangerous as there are many off-lying hazards, strong tidal streams, and frequent gales. This is more than made up for by such attractive ports as Morlaix, St Malo or Lézardrieux. Best facilities for yachts can be found at Brest, La Trinité, La Rochelle, Lorient, and Bordeaux. The western coast divides into three distinct areas, the most popular and picturesque being the Brittany coast, which has many navigable rivers and the Morbihan inland sea. The central area to the Gironde has several off-lying islands as well as the great rivers, the Loire and the Gironde, which lead into the inland waterways. The low-lying area stretching to the Spanish border is the least appealing as a cruising destination.Mediterranean France is more suited to those who prefer to find their pleasures ashore. Sailing into such glittering places as St Tropez, Cannes or Antibes is an experience that cannot be repeated and it is worth the long detour just to spend some time among the most beautiful collection of yachts in the world. Excellent facilities are at Antibes, in the St Tropez-Cogolin area, Toulon and Marseilles, although the latter deals mainly with commercial shipping. Many harbors east of Toulon charge from noon to noon, not on the basis of a 24 hour period from arrival. Also, charter boats abound in this area. It should be noted that many ports and marinas are full to capacity during the summer season and it can be difficult to find space.The island of Corsica offers a wide selection of ports ideally to be visited outside of the peak summer season as it is a favorite holiday destination for French sailors. Facilities are best at the main port of Ajaccio on the west coast and Bastia on the east coast.The Atlantic and Mediterranean are connected by a canal route of 314 miles (503 km) with 139 locks, from Bordeaux on the River Garonne, to Castets where the Canal Latéral à la Garonne runs to Toulouse, from where the Canal du Midi leads to Sète in the Mediterranean. Other canals and river systems go into the heart of Brittany, through the centre of Paris, the eastern part of France and the Rhône river to the Mediterranean. The Northern France waterway can be entered at Dunkerque, Calais, Gravelines or St Valéry-sur-Somme, while the Brittany Canal runs from the English Channel to the Bay of Biscay through 63 locks from St Malo via Dinas, Rennes, Redan and the River Vilaine. For more details on the Inland Waterways of Europe seethis Noonsite Report.France is one of the leading sailing nations in the world and its top sailors are as well known to the general French public as its best soccer players. With the most developed yacht building industry in Europe, yachting facilities generally are of a high standard. Chandlery and repair facilities are widely available and small repairs can be undertaken in most ports. For more complicated or specialized jobs it is best to go to one of the major centers, where there are established boatyards and specialist companies offering a complete range of repair facilities.

There are 2,000 Greek islands, but only 168 are inhabited.\nAthens is the capital of Greece.\nThe population is estimated at 10.7 million people.\nThe vast majority speak Greek, which is the country’s official language. The other languages spoken are Macedonian (called “Slav-Macedonian” in Greece), Albanian, spoken in the centre and the south, Turkish, spoken by Muslim communities around the Aegean, Arumanian and Bulgarian. None of these minority languages has official status.\nGreece is part of the European Union and the currency is the Euro.\nThe standard time is Eastern European Time (UTC+02:00). SeeGeneral Info. for more details.\nThe climate along the coastline is Mediterranean in character: mild moist winters and dry hot summers. SeeWeatherfor more details.\nThe crowds are also seasonal and it certainly pays to cruise Greece outside of the peak summer months, ideally around Easter, which is the main holiday in the Greek Orthodox calendar. The autumn months are just as attractive; both winds and weather are more pleasant than in the Meltemi-swept months of high summer.\nAlthough the more popular places on the Aegean are quite crowded, especially during the high season, there are still plenty of less frequented places dotted around the rim of the Aegean and some of the more remote islands rarely see more than a handful of yachts.\nThe recent expansion in yachting has been accompanied by a parallel development in facilities, but fortunately, none of the picturesque ports have been ruined by the construction of pontoons in centuries-old harbors. Most marinas have been built inside newly built breakwaters or reclaimed land and in most islands yachts still either come stern-to the existing quay, if there is space or stay at anchor. Most of the new marinas are on the mainland and this is also where the best repair facilities are.\nIf looking to take an annual contract in a Greek marina, be aware that it may well stipulate that you avoid the marina during the summer months, or have your boat on the hard during the summer. This may be due to the availability of space for charter fleets or for visiting yachts, which is where most marinas here make their money.\nThe greatest concentration of facilities is in the Athens-Piraeus area, where there are several boatyards with haul-out facilities and a full range of repair services.

More and more ports are making this a mandatory requirement and fining boats that arrive expecting to be able to secure a Transit Log on arrival. Non EU Flag Yachts should apply online prior to arrival or prior to start the paperwork upon arrival and wait for the Transit Log approval. They will receive a message to visit customs for the fee payment or for additional documents required.\nFull details about the Transit Log can be found inDocuments.\nAuthorities in the Eastern Aegean do recommend checking into Greece through an agency. By law, this is optional, however rules and regulations are tightening up, plus harbor fees must be paid via an agency. In order to ensure a straightforward clearance, it may be simpler to use an agency, particularly if your situation is out of the ordinary. Agencies can also assist with registration and payment of the E-TEPAI and Transit Log.\nNEW European Entry and Exit System (EES)– launched 12 October, 2025, means for non-EU crew biometric data will need to be recorded on entry and exit. This will require a visit to an official office at a port of entry. SeeImmigrationfor more details.\nPleasure boats (under any flag), arriving from outside the Schengen Area, are allowed to enter the harbours designated as Schengen Area ports of entry where there are Port Police who can complete the appropriate entry forms. Some ports of entry are only open during the season (May to October). All ports of entry are clearly labelled in the ports list (anchor icon “Explore country” button).\nSome ports of entry are more “yacht friendly” than others. Leros and Kalimnos in the Dodecanese and Corfu and Cefalonia in the Ionian, are reported to fall into this category.\nAs Greece is a member of the European Union (EU), formalities for EU vessels and EU nationals should be simple, although this does not always appear to be the case.\nThe Hellenic Coast Guard, colloquially known as Port Police or PP, should officiallyonly be visitedwhen:\n(1) entering the country from outside the Schengen Area/EU,\n(2) to have your Transit Log (TL – Greek cruising papers) checked and stamped (if a TL is required – see below).\nOn entering the country, the PP will want to see the yacht registration certificate, the Greek language certificate of third party insurance (seeDocumentsbelow with revised limits and note the new law regarding charter yachts) and they will ask for a crew list with passport numbers and birth dates (bring at least 3 copies). If you don’t have a crew list and they have to make one up for you, they will charge for this (approx. 5 Euros a copy). Very rarely, other certificates (competence or radio) may be asked for .\nThey will also want to see proof that the E-TEPAI has been paid. This can be paid to Customs if you have been unable to pay online.\nWhen entering Greece from a non-EU country, all yachts must proceed to Customs. In addition, all yachts requiring a Transit Log will need to visit Customs (see details below). Not all ports have a Customs dock for this purpose. Customs will want to see proof of your VAT status*. SeeDocumentsfor details.\n*It should be noted that some Customs at Greek ports of entry are being particular about checking all yachts, even those that are EU flagged and have come from within the EU to Greece.\nEU yachts can stay indefinitely in Greece.Other than visiting the Port Police if arriving from outside the EU (and visiting Immigration if you have non-EU crew on board), the only requirement for EU boats over seven meters (23 ft) is to keep a detailed log of Crew/Passengers, with joining and leaving details, and passport numbers.Rules for EU flagged vessels changed 1 April, 2020, when theDEKPA was abolished.Important Note for Polish-flagged yachts:Greek Customs requires that every yacht which is entering in Greek Waters under Polish Flag should refer to Customs in order to prove its VAT Status. In the event that the yacht is No-VAT Paid, it will then be handled as Non-EU (see below) and will be issued with a 30-day Transit Log (within the same year).See news item for details.

In some smaller ports, the PP have been designated managers for the quay.

Where reported, Noonsite has made a note under ports that are reported to be expensive or difficult.With the introduction of Law 4256 which came into effect on 14 April 2014, PP permission is no longer needed when arriving in the harbor, to haul out, to re-launch, to leave harbor, or to change crew lists. The PP have been told of all new procedures and regulations, however, you may find that in some ports the PP are still ignoring instructions and clinging to old procedures, or charging widely different fees to those published here.Note that the Greek Coast Guard does not monitor or call on VHF Channel 16. If you require assistance you must call them on VHF Channel 12. Monitor VHF Channel 12 on entering a port in case the port police wish to call you. However, be cautious about calling for assistance via VHF (use a mobile instead, if possible) as it is very likely you will be caught up in the Greek legal system.In the case of a distress call or a boat being towed into a harbor, the boat may be detained until it has been declared seaworthy. This could involve an expensive visit from an authorized surveyor.Also, the port police must be informed of all injuries suffered on board any vessel in Greek waters.

The main areas where theft is on the rise is around Athens and the major harbors and resorts. Take sensible precautions with securing your boat and equipment, as you would anywhere.\nThere are regular strikes in Greece which are sometimes called at short notice and can cause disruption to public transport in and out of the country (including air travel and ports). Demonstrations take place regularly in central Athens and have also taken place in other towns and cities. You should avoid all demonstrations and follow the advice given by local security authorities.\nFor travel advisories, see the following websites:\nUK –gov.uk/foreign-travel-adviceUSA –https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.htmlCanada –voyage.gc.caNew Zealand –safetravel.govt.nzAustralia-smartraveller.gov.au\nUK –gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\nUSA –https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html\nNew Zealand –safetravel.govt.nz\nAustralia-smartraveller.gov.au\nMigrant Situation:Since the Migrant Crisis began in 2015, people are still trying to reach Europe with most migrants coming through the Eastern Mediterranean. A large proportion of migrants have first set foot on European soil in the Greek islands of the Eastern Aegean. Thousands have ended up in camps on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos.\nGreece has stepped up security on its borders, particularly in the Eastern Sporades and Dodecanese. With the increase in Greek Coastguard patrols it is wise to keep a listening watch on VHF Channel 16 at all times. Increased pressure from Turkey to stop migrants leaving Turkish shores has seen a dramatic decrease in numbers attempting the journey,however many still do. In 2020 the Greek Government were planning toinstall a floating barrier off the island of Lesbosas an emergency measure to try and reduce the flow of migrants to Greece.\nIf recreational vessels spot migrant boats, it is important to have a plan to avoid interaction. Migrants have been known to sink their own boats to force a rescue mission. Contact the Coast Guard to notify them of the position of any migrant boats encountered so that the appropriate action can be taken.\nGPS Interference:A continuing problem when sailing between Crete and Suez is that no NTMs are issued if the signals are being blocked for training. The Maritime Administration (MARAD) posted an Advisory stating that multiple instances of significant GPS interference have been reported worldwide in the maritime domain, resulting in lost or inaccurate GPS signals. It could put one 20-200 nm away from where one thinks. Plotting one’s course on paper charts can help recognize that this is happening.\nEgina, Palanco Boatyard, 2018:Attempted Theft.\nEgina, Palanco Boatyard, 2018:Attempted Theft.\nBe sure to checkrelated security reports for Greece.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

You need to provide your ETA to ATCL 24 hours before your arrival in Lebanon.\nAt 12NM from the coast, call the Lebanese Navy (call sign Oscar Charlie) on VHF Channel 11 or 16, request permission to enter Lebanese waters and advise them of which marina you are heading to for inward clearance.\nOnly after receiving permission, should the yacht proceed.\nThe authorities should be contacted again when 6NM from the marina entrance. The arrival should be timed to be during daylight hours. The port captain should be contacted on Channel 16 when about to enter the marina to be given directions to a free berth.\nAll formalities are completed in the marina and there are various clearance fees, which can be paid in US dollars.\nYou will be asked for a port clearance form from your last port (zarpe) and they estimate the time you have been at sea from leaving there and arriving in Lebanon. It is no use handing in a two week old Port Said form as you will be asked to leave. This also applies to Syria.\nCustoms will issue you with a 3 month cruising permit. This can be renewed. There is a Customs charge.\nImmigration will want to see passports, and there is also an Immigration charge.\nAs with all yacht movements in Lebanon, Military Operation Control (Oscar Charlie) must be contacted prior to departure or arrival at any port in Lebanon, even when already cleared into the country.\nAn unreported movement will soon be followed by a visit from a Lebanese Navy patrol boat and endless questions.\nImmigration must be visited on departure and arrival, from and to any subsequent marina after clearing into the country. There is a departure and arrival charge each time.\nOvernight anchoring is not permitted, however, daytime anchoring is possible as long as you return to the marina before dark.\nClearing out requires an agent, for which there is a charge, although the ATCL marina includes this service for visiting yachts.\nSee Fees for details of all charges.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

Make an advance reservation.\nYachts approaching the Montenegro coast should expect to be intercepted by naval craft patrolling the area. Upon entry to Montenegro waters vessels must monitor Montenegro VTS on channel 11 and channel 16.\nAll yachts must proceed to the nearest Port of Entry which include: Bar, Zelenika, Tivat, and Kotor.

Entry through other ports is prohibited.\nAnchoring between (official) ports is currently not permitted unless you have obtained permission (see domestic cruising below).\nAn official list of ports for leisure vessels with port information can be found here:Agence Nationale des Ports.\nAll crew members, including the captain, should remain on board until formalities have been completed. The marina will act as your guide/agent, throughout the clearance process. Officials will come to the boat in most ports. But it may be necessary for the captain to go ashore to look for the officials in order to report the yacht’s arrival and request clearance.\nPolice/Immigration are usually in civilian clothes, Gendarmerie Royale, always in uniform and sometimes Customs.\nSpeaking French is very helpful as it makes formalities much easier. Also, having a ship’s stamp (or any other stamp) is very useful as you have to fill in the same papers as a cargo ship.\nCustoms:Within 24 hours of arrival, the skipper must report to the customs office to check-in and get a Temporary Admission document (AT) – or a Sailing Permit. This is a tiny slip of paper which can easily get lost – the size of a credit card. Customs will stamp it when you depart. Keep it somewhere safe so it doesn’t get mistaken for a receipt and binned.See Documentsfor the paperwork required andCustomsfor more details on temporary admission and Customs rules. Customs will require an inventory and a crew list and they sometimes keep the ship’s papers until departure. Note, drones and firearms are banned and must be declared.Port Captain:An entry declaration must be filled in at the Capitainerie office (Port Captain’s office).Immigration:It is also necessary to clear with Immigration, who may keep passports until departure and will issue a shore pass.

The only things you need are passports, ships papers, insurance certificate and lots of patience and politeness.\nIt isabsolutely requiredto clear in and out of each port. DO NOT leave a port without conducting clearance procedures.\nEvery time you arrive and leave a port you have to go through police, customs and port clearance. Be prepared for inspection dogs to go through the boat each time. Passports will likely be stamped and you must present your sailing permit (TI doc.). Occasionally photographs may be taken of the boat and crew by officials.\nFor each entry and exit allow 3 hours.\nCustoms is supposed to issue a blue Customs document that should be presented at each subsequent port. On departure from the country, the blue part will be kept by Customs and you leave with the white part. However, this rarely happens.See this reportfrom 2018 with more details.\nAnchoring between (official) ports is not permitted unless you have obtained permission – the same applies to landing with a dinghy. Ask the Gendarmerie Royale and they will put you in contact with the right people. If you don’t succeed the first time, wait until somebody else is on duty and ask the same question again. There are specific areas where anchoring is assumed to be okay (for example: outside Mohammedia Port if the docks are full), but it is good practice to ask the Harbor Master – even if it is assumed.\nOn departure, you must present your AT document (temporary admission) to Customs and complete a Customs declaration.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

{"id": "russia_main", "country": "Russia", "section_type": "main", "url": "https://www.noonsite.com/place/russia/", "content": "ALERT: On 24 February 2022 Russia launched a large scale invasion of Ukraine which is ongoing.\nImportant pre-arrival information:Foreign yachts must arrive with visas for each crew member obtained in advance – however if your visit is for less than 8 days an e-visa is now possible.See Formalities for more information.\nThe break-up of the Soviet Union has radically altered the cruising picture in both the Baltic and Black Sea. Unfortunately, while the countries themselves have undergone a profound process of liberalisation, rules affecting the movement of foreign vessels have seen only a limited relaxation compared to the Soviet past. In this respect, Russia is the worst culprit and formalities for visiting yachts are just as cumbersome as in the past. Foreign vessels and their crews continue to be viewed with a high degree of suspicion and the officials one has to deal with can be just as difficult and unpleasant as their Soviet predecessors. After an initial outburst of interest, the number of cruising boats visiting Russia has levelled off as sailors realise that visiting Russia on their own boat is perhaps not worth all the aggravation.\nSince the beginning of June 2012, it is now permitted for foreign vessels to cruise all of Russia’s inland waterways – in theory!  The details are still being worked out and all the officials involved informed. No special permit is required but one crew member has to be a Russian speaker. On some sections of waterway, a pilot is necessary.\nEven if not always rigidly enforced, many of the restrictions introduced during the Soviet era have remained basically unchanged, so one should not expect the same kind of freedom of movement as is enjoyed by land tourists. Although foreign yachts can now enter Russian coastal waters, obtaining visas and permission for entry remains complicated. An invitation from an authorised body, such as a yacht club, is essential. Russian consulates will issue visas for all those named in the invitation with dates of birth and passport numbers for the period and the ports stated in the invitation. A vessel which takes shelter or stops in a port not specified in the visa can expect difficulties. (There are three Russian ports in the Eastern part of the Gulf of Finland which can be visited by foreign boats. It is enough to specify St.Petersburg in your visa to be able to visit the other two).\nThe lack of adequate facilities for visiting boats, unnecessarily complicated and time-consuming formalities, difficult officials and the distinct feeling that many Russians regard foreigners as nothing more than a convenient source of cash, should make anyone planning a visit to Russia consider seriously if the effort is really worth it.\nShould the situation improve, from the cruising point of view, Russia has three main areas which can be visited, all very different in their own ways.\nTheBlack Seacoast is now very much diminished following the independence of Georgia and Ukraine. The Black Sea ports, none of which are recognised Ports of Entry for yachts (they are commercial POE), discourage visits by foreign private yachts by obstructive bureaucracy and extremely high harbour charges. It is advisable to remain well clear of Russian territorial waters in the Black Sea. Since 2014, it is also now advisable to also avoid the Crimea. No foreign yachts have reported visiting here in recent years. What little information there is about these ports can be found in the RCCPF files inpublications\nThe main attraction on theBaltic Coastis the historic city of St Petersburg, built on the banks of the River Neva and considered the most beautiful Russian city. The sea area between St Petersburg and Kronstadt, inside a man-made seawall, is a popular cruising area for Russian sailors. A highly enjoyable detour can now be made into the Finnish Saimaa Canal which gives access to Saimaa Lake, but whose entrance was barred in the past to foreign vessels. These restrictions have now been lifted by the Russian authorities. The Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad has been open to tourists since 1991, a small region of Russia squeezed between Lithuania and Poland and separated from the rest of Russia.\nYacht building is gathering pace as there is a great demand for cruising boats. Although not up to western standards, repair facilities are good, as local mechanics are used to improvising when spares are not available. The situation regarding marine supplies and spares is gradually improving. Ordering essential spares from abroad and clearing them through customs can take a very long time.\nProvisioning can be quite difficult as the yacht clubs are often out of town. There is usually a good selection of fresh produce which is better quality in the markets than in the large stores. Water is readily available, but the quality is sometimes questionable, so it should be treated; bottled water is widely available. Fuel is difficult to obtain, so it is best to order some via a yacht club or agency. There are two regular floating fuel stations at the River YC (of which one is a very modern one).\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

{"id": "russia_clearance", "country": "Russia", "section_type": "clearance", "url": "https://www.noonsite.com/place/russia/view/clearance/", "content": "Russia requires all visitors to have a visa. There is now a more straightforward e-visa available online, if you are visiting for no more than 8 days. Alternatively, if you wish to visit for longer, you must have a letter of invitation (for example from a friendly sailing club) in order to get a 4 week tourist visa.See Immigrationfor more details.\nAn agent must be employed for the clearing in procedure.\nyachts should be attentive as to where they enter Russian territorial waters.\nIn the Finnish Gulf, it is recommended to follow the Sea Channel and cross the territorial water line between Gogland (Hochland) Island and Moshniy. Most yachts clearing out of Finland at Haapasaari Island normally cross the territorial water line between Gogland and Sommers Islands. At this point, one should attempt to raise the authorities on VHF Channel 16. Some yachts have been fined for entering Russian territorial waters in a non-approved place.\nThe Biorkesund Passage is now open to yachts. There is pressure on the authorities to open Gogland Island also to yachts, which would save some sea miles.\nIt is forbidden to stop at any of the islands in Russian waters. Sheltering from bad weather is not considered a valid reason. It was mentioned at one of the meetings of the St.Petersburg Coast Guard with the local yachtsmen that sheltering from “real” bad weather would be considered a valid reason.\nNote that if sailing between Poland and Lithuania and not intending to visit Kaliningrad, it is necessary to remain about 20NM offshore when passing this area to avoid the attention of Russian Patrol boats (territorial waters extend only 12NM but they often venture further out and will question any boats they see).\nYachts may be intercepted by a patrol boat at any time on entering territorial waters. If such a vessel does not answer calls on VHF Channel 16, one should try Channel 10, which is their normal working channel.\nYou MUST stay within any marked channel: it is absolutely forbidden for a foreign boat to stray more than 3.2 kms (two miles – preferably 1.6 kms) outside of a marked channel.\nForeign yachts must arrive with visas for each crew member obtained in advance and landfall must be made at one of the ports specified in the visa (not that important as far as the ports of the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland are concerned).\nYacht crew arriving with an e-visa can only enter the country at eitherKaliningradorSaint Petersburg.\nIf arriving with a tourist visa it can only be used for one port of entry. If wishing to visit both Kaliningrad and Saint Petersburg a double entry visa must be obtained.\nIf entering Russia from Finland via the Saimaa Canal, one can clear in at Vyborg or Brusnichnoye and proceed to Saint Petersburg via Vysozk. This route, which is used by Finnish boats, has been reported as being simpler and with less red tape.\nAs you cross the Russian border, call “Russian Coastguard” on VHF Channel 16 or 74. Give the name of the boat, call sign, position (lat & long), course, speed, destination and number of persons on board. They may not speak English.\nForeign vessels must clear in and out with the Frontier Guard, Customs and Immigration in all Ports of Entry. No one must leave the boat until formalities have been completed; officials will come to the boat.\nForeign vessels are required to notify the authorities in the next port one intends to visit three days in advance, with a crew list, boat details and purpose of visit. (Your agent is expected to provide the authorities with this information).\nVessels which seek shelter or stop in ports not mentioned in the visa may have difficulties. If wishing to stop at a port where there are no officials, permission to do so and clearance must be obtained from the nearest port of entry.\nYachts intending to combine a visit to the Saimaa Lakes in Finland with a visit to Saint Petersburg are advised to visit Saint Petersburg first. Problems have been experienced because passports have been stamped when transiting the Saimaa Canal (which runs through Russian territory) and this has been interpreted as using the Visa needed for St Petersburg.\nThe authorities must be notified 24 hours in advance of departure.\nIn summary, visiting Russia by private yacht is difficult and, if not part of a pre-arranged rally, involves a lot of questioning, suspicion and paperwork. This is especially the case at the Black Sea ports, visiting which is not currently advisable.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

This will require a visit to an official office at a port of entry. SeeImmigrationfor more details.\nBoats from other EU countries need only to clear in if arriving from outside the EU. In practice, however, the authorities expect to be informed of one’s arrival even if coming from a neighboring EU country.\nAs a result of the implementation of the Schengen Agreement, boats having on board nationals of EU countries that are not signatories of the Schengen Agreement must clear Immigration at the port of entry into Spain.\nIn the case of non-EU boats, the captain and all crew should proceed ashore and clear Customs (Aduana) and Immigration (Frontier Police) at a port of entry. You will be issued with a special form and an inventory of yacht equipment and crew lists will be required (see documents for more details).\nAll non-EU crew will need to go with the Captain to get their passports stamped, however it’s quite possible that if the yacht is in transit and moving on to another port (and no crew are leaving the boat), Immigration won’t stamp the passports. Some Spanish ports interpret the EU regulations as such that recreational navigation is viewed as not “travelling within the country”. If, however, you wish your passport stamped, the authorities can give you details as to how to locate the nearest border office.\nNon-EU crew that are departing the boat will have their passports stamped.\nWhile a visit to Customs should be made, many Spanish ports of entry Customs won’t show much interest and non-EU boats may well find that recording first entry into the EU with the boat in Spain is not a straightforward task.See the European Union page for more details.\nIn some ports officials may come to inspect the boat. Special care must be taken when filling in a marina or shipyard’s entry forms as these will be sent off to the Border Police Office and revised. Therefore, if you come from an EU port, make sure this is stated. The same applies if you come from a non-EU port.\nAs of April 16, 2022, Russian-flagged vessels, including those that changed their flag after February 24, 2022, are prohibited from entering Spanish ports due to EU sanctions. Seenews itemfor details\nAfter having cleared into Spain, the procedure at subsequent ports and anchorages seems to depend on the attitude of local officials. However, one should be prepared to show all relevant documents whenever asked. One may be asked for registration papers, crew lists, certificate of competence and proof of marine insurance.\nAn EU boat with all EU citizens on board going to another EU country does not need to officially clear out.\nIf leaving the EU, then the skipper should the check local regulations and, if possible, obtain a ‘zarpe’ or other official clearance document, to show that they legally left their previous destination when arriving in a new country. This is normally issued by Customs.\nA non-EU boat leaving Spain for another Schengen country, assuming the correct arrival procedure has been followed, can visit other ports in other Schengen countries without any further checks. However, if intending to return to Spain it’s worth going to Customs on departure so they can record the date of departure on the Customs permit. This permit can be used again if re-entering Spain within the period of its validity. Each arrival and departure must be noted by Customs on the permit.\nA non-EU boat leaving Spain and leaving Schengen, must complete a departure declaration and report to Customs at an official port of entry/departure so that their movement out of the Schengen Area has been recorded. Any non-EU crew should report to passport control when leaving the Schengen Area.\nAt least one member of the crew should have a VHF radio operators certificate.\nWatch out forLight Dues, charged at many ports for a minimum of 30 days, which can make short stays very expensive.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

Rules change (often quite quickly) and their interpretation by ports of call are often different from one another. Some ports now insist that you use an agent (Marmaris for example). Due to language difficulties, it may be easier to use an agent anyway. Many marinas can act as an agent.Feescan vary greatly, get quotes from agents in a few different ports of entry to determine the best value and service. Be sure to appoint an agent prior to departing for Türkiye.\nIt has been confirmed by a yacht agency in Finike that no matter the nationality of the boat owner or flag of the vessel, if you declare your last port as being Southern Cyprus you will not be permitted to enter Türkiye. In Finike, only a verbal declaration is required, last port clearance papers are not inspected, however, this may not be the case in other Turkish ports. There have been cases of yachts declaring their last port as S. Cyprus and them being turned away, meaning a diversion to Greece before returning to Türkiye. It is recommended that yachts coming to Türkiye from S. Cyprus with AIS on board should turn off their AIS devices a few days prior to departure and turn them on again when approaching Türkiye. Using an agent will help smooth the entry clearance.\nYachts flying the ensign of the Republic of Cyprus will be refused entry to Turkish ports. This situation will, presumably, change if/when Türkiye becomes a member of the European Union, but at present, this rule is being enforced.\nDischarge of waste regulations now applies to all the Turkish coastline.

SeeRestrictionsfor more details.\nAny yacht coming from abroad must fly the Q flag and complete formalities at an official port of entry.\nOn entry, formalities are completed with Harbour Master, Health, Passport Police and Customs, in that order.\nThe agent will provide the TL and deal with formalities. They will require the ships papers, insurance certificate, skippers license, and passports.\nThe skipper’s name should appear on the yachts’ registration certificate or on some official proof of ownership. Generally, it is wise to ask for receipts for any payments.\nForeign-flagged yachts, on condition that they are sailed by their owners once every two years, can remain in Türkiye for up to five years without a requirement for any permission. For further details seeCustoms.\nTransiting The Bosphorus or The Dardanelles\nWhen within eight km (five miles) of the entrance into either the Bosphorus or the Dardanelles, boats should contact Traffic Control for further instructions. Although this provision only applies to boats over 20 meters LOA, it is recommended that smaller boats also comply with it. Boats in possession of a TL are no longer required to stop at Canakkale and may proceed through the Dardanelles without stopping. The regulations are similar for boats going through the Bosphorus, who may continue towards ports on the Turkish Black Sea coast without stopping.\nYou can now expect the Turkish Coast Guard to be more rigorous in checking documents of yachts cruising in this area.\nDeparture from Türkiye must be from an official Port of Entry and an agent is required to prepare all the paperwork and submit it to the various authorities.\nIf a yacht is leaving Turkish waters (even for a brief period) and planning to return within the time the TL is valid, it must be surrendered on departure, and a new one obtained on re-entry.\nWhen departing for foreign ports, yachts are required to complete full clearance procedures and surrender of the TL with Harbour Master, Passport Police, and Customs, in that order.\nPrior to clearing out, it is recommended cruisers speak to the Harbour Master first. Double handed yachts (just two crew) have reported that they were not required to use an agent for clearing out, in particular inBodrum. Agents charge approx. 85 Euros for this service.\nPlease note that Visas for individuals are multiple entry, but the TL is not. If Türkiye is left in an emergency, without having been able to clear out correctly, the completed Section V should be handed into a Turkish consulate abroad within one month, otherwise, the yacht cannot return.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

Consequently, many ports have an abundance of Yacht Clubs, when in fact the majority are dinghy sailing clubs with no facilities for visiting cruising boats.\nSeveral rallies held in the Black Sea in recent years have persuaded the authorities to bring about some considerable improvements to the yachting infrastructure.

Djibouti port is the main supply route for land-locked Ethiopia.\nDjibouti is a convenient port of call for both east or westbound yachts. Those bound for the Mediterranean arrive in Djibouti during the NE monsoon, mainly between January and March.\nExploring the Gulf of Tadjourah and Ghoubet Al Khareb should not be missed, however, obtaining permission is rather complicated, greatly eased by using the right agent.\nDjibouti sits on the Afar Triple Junction where the African, Somali and Arabian tectonic plates meet. As a result, the scenery is spectacular with volcanic rock, lava flows, hot springs, salt lakes, petrified forests, and an almost extra-terrestrial landscape.\nThe French maintain a naval base in the port which means that provisioning is good, better than Aden, although as the majority of goods are imported they tend to be more expensive.\nRepair facilities for yachts are very limited, although you may be able to find a few workshops capable of carrying out simple repairs.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

Using an agent greatly simplifies the entry process which is still very much geared towards commercial shipping.  Recent reports (The Red Sea – August 2023) indicate that while it can be expensive with extra charges, the right agent can make your stop over a pleasant and easy experience. It is also possible to undertake clearance here without an agent, it just takes a little more time according to cruisers who visited in 2023.  If planning to explore local waters and spend some time cruising here, use of an agent is definitely recommended to avoid any problems. SeeClearance Agents.\nBe sure to look at agent recommendations from other cruisers and get a few quotes for entry costs. Cargo agents will try and charge commercial shipping fees to small yachts, so find an agent that is used to dealing with small craft. Some cruisers have reported being quoted silly amounts. Communicate your programme to your agent well in advance of your arrival so all the necessary arrangements can be made.\nBoat documentation, crew list, passport copies and exit zarpe from your last port must all be sent in advance to your agent. Your agent will present these to the Coastguard and Navy so they know who you are when you show up on AIS, meaning you shouldn’t experience any problems on approaches to Djibouti.\nOnce in Djibouti waters, monitor VHF Channel 16 at all times so the Coast Guard/Navy and authorities can communicate with you as you approach the harbor. If nothing heard, call Port Control Djibouti when 10NM from the harbor on VHF Channel 10 (they may not answer). The Djibouti Navy operates on VHF Channel 16.\nContact your agent as soon as you enter port and they will meet you with all the necessary forms.\nIf you plan to stop in Djibouti just for rest and refuel with no need to sail within the area, the clearance procedure is straightforward.\nTie up to the concrete wall where all the tug boats are. It’s not particularly dinghy friendly but there are some ladders or large tyres to tie up to and climb up (easiest at high tide – at low tide, this might be 13 feet and at high tide 6 feet).\nPosition of the wall:  11°36.589’N 43°8.124’E.\nYou will need to visit the following authorities:\nPort Captain “Capitainerie du port”: They speak English, will ask for some paperwork and explain the costs for anchoring.  Tel: +25377819639.  Position:  11°36.658’N 43°8.081’E.  (note:  there are four wooden doors in a very old building – it’s the one on the left.\nImmigration Office: One minute walk from the Harbour master’s office.  Position: 11°36.670’N 43°8.122’E .  All crew will be issued with visas which are valid for 30 days. Seefeesfor charges. You will also be issued with a shore pass. (It is advisable to have the exact amount to pay for the visas.)\nQuarantine:The Quarantine Officer will take the temperature of all crew and will want to see International Vaccination Travel Record books and check for Yellow Fever vaccination.\nYou can arrange for a water taxi service to shore (for a fee) so you don’t have to use your dinghy.\nYachts that want to cruise the country outside of Djibouti port must obtain Cruising Permits from the Tourist Office and Maritime Affairs. The process is very complicated and you are well advised to use an agent to assist. SeeDocumentsfor more details.\nVisit the Capitainerie first where you will get your port clearance and pay the anchorage fee in local currency. It is 5700 Djibouti franc (about US$30) for 1-4 days.  Again it is advisable to have the correct amount as officials rarely have change.\nThen checkout at immigration where they will stamp your passport(s), a very quick process – less than five minutes according to recent reports.   It is advisable to give officials up to 48 hours notice so they have time to prepare all the paperwork.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

The new procedures and tariff have been applied to all Egyptian ports and marinas with the exception of  the Suez Canal, so far. It is Noonsite’s recommendation to appoint an agent well in advance of your arrival, who can correctly guide you as to which port is the cheapest to check-into and out of Egypt and to avoid paying excessively high fees.\nNoonsite does not recommend any particular agent, however, there is a list of Clearance agentsherethat are regularly used by cruising boats. It can be useful to look atreports from cruisersfor their various experiences with agents and cruisers comments under the “Explore Country” tab.\nIt is highly likely you will need an agent at every major port (many are stipulating this now). For example inPort Ghalibthere are two licensed agents as approved by the Egyptian Maritime Transport Sector and it is mandatory that all yachts use one of these agents for clearance. Authorities don’t usually speak English and will only deal with the agents they know.\nSend your agent clearance documents 72hrs prior to arrival (Registry Certificate, Crew List, Last Port Clearance, Photo of Passport, etc.) and e-mail the marina in advance to alert them of your arrival including ETA, Yacht details, Period of stay, diesel if you need it, Registration Certificate, Crew List, Last Port Clearance, Last 10 Ports of call, and Period of stay.\nFind out if you need a visa to enter Egypt.See Immigrationfor more details.\nIf you simply are transiting through Egypt via the Suez Canal and don’t intend to go ashore, you don’t need to check-into the country.\nDetailed Suez Canal transit notes, regulations and fees payable are exclusively available to Noonsite Members, via the green special offers bar.\nBasic transit costs are outlined inEgypt Fees.\nThe majority of yachts coming from the south check into Egypt atPort Ghalib MarinaorHurghada Port. Port Ghalib currently has incredibly high fees, as does Hurghada. Agents recommend that based on the government’s new tariff, the best/cheapest port for check-in/out isSuez, at this time, as the new government bill has not yet been applied to the Suez Canal marinas. SeeFeesfor more details.\nIf sheltering from strong winds or making an overnight stop, yachts are normally allowed to stay in Egyptian waters before clearing in at an official port of entry. If coming from the Red Sea and intending to stop in Egypt before clearing in, it is advisable to have obtained a visa in advance. It is also advisable not to actually go ashore until officially cleared in.\nTo see a list of the best recommended (and permitted) stopovers on the way to Port Suez –go to Restrictions.\nYour agent will usually be in contact from the moment you enter Egypt’s territorial waters to provide the necessary support and give the  exact position for the most appropriate non-prohibited places for anchoring in case of an emergency.\nYachts coming from the north normally check in atPort Said.

If you want to go ashore you must clear in at a port of entry, and then IN and OUT of every port afterwards. This is prohibitively expensive and well beyond the financial means of most cruisers. If you wish to explore Egypt, the most reasonable and safest option for your boat is to clear into the country at Ismailia, berth the boat at the newly renovated marina and explore inland from there. Stopping at anchorages to seek refuge from contrary winds is permitted, but you cannot go ashore.\nIf transiting the Suez Canal and not stopping anywhere else after the transit, the outward clearance can be obtained while doing the transit formalities. Yachts may then proceed to sea as soon as they have dropped the pilot.\nOnce outward clearance is obtained, yachts must leave within 24 hours, or obtain another clearance.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

It is advantageous to provide the following details prior to arrival:Yacht Name, LOA, beam, draft, flag, port of registry and registration number. Name of Master, Masters Passport No., Last Port, Departure Date. No. of Crew and crew details, including nationality and passport numbers. If anyone is flying out of Sri Lanka list them as passengers and not crew.\nSeeSri Lanka/Clearance Agentsfor a list of agents. Agents must charge as per a government price tariff, however, there are still price differences between the agents, so ask for several quotes and shop around.\nBe sure to have applied for a tourist visa, online, prior to departure for Sri Lanka, and have the e-mail confirmation of the visa approval at hand to show Immigration officers on arrival.See Immigration for more details.\nIt is advisable to be able to communicate with Sri Lankan authorities (or your agent) en route and provide them with regular updates.\nArriving yachts must also call the Port Authority on VHF Channel 16 when approximately 1.5NM off, to notify them of arrival, but it is common that yachts will be contacted by the Port Authority prior. (Keep a listening watch on VHF Channel 16 at all times when operating in Sri Lankan territory.)\nNote:Be sure to arrive with your chosen Sri Lankan port of clearance on your exit zarpe from your previous port. If you have “Maldives” or other on your zarpe, this can cause a lot of problems. Also, it’s not possible to enter Galle port at night.\nClearance must be carried out through the agent, both on arrival and departure. The agent is supposed to ensure that the captain complies with port and immigration regulations, that he has sufficient funds in foreign exchange for the fees and that all port dues and customs duties are settled before departure.\nBe prepared to fill out a large number of forms, and have a boat stamp handy.\nThe agent will be the first to  come out to your boat and will bring some, or all, of the following officers with him to complete the formalities:\nHealth Officer:The health officer will carry out the quarantine inspection and there will be medical forms to complete, plus a compulsory health check for all crew conducted by the port doctor. The health officer wlil then grant “pratique” (clean bill of health).\nCustoms Officer:The yacht will then be inspected by a Customs officer, who will require the last port clearance.\nPort Authority: A Port Authority official will come out to the boat during office hours (06:00-12:00, 13:00-16:00 Monday to Friday) to fill in an arrival report (yacht details, crew list, etc.). The port authority will indicate the area in each port where yachts may anchor. The Port Authority tightly controls yacht movements and anchoring – particularly inTrincomalee– and schedules are kept to the minute. Yachts should not move from their original mooring without the Harbour Master’s permission. Permission is also needed before hauling out a yacht. Land the dinghy at the appointed places in each port.\nImmigration Officer:The Immigration Officer will come to the yacht to complete his formalities. Crew lists and details of any passengers or crew who are leaving the vessel have to be given to Immigration. You will also have to go to the Immigration officer to collect your visa (approved by the online system ahead of arrival –see Immigration for details).\nDomestic Cruising in Sri Lanka:\nAfter completing clearance at your port of entry, it is possible to sail to other ports provided you obtain a Sri Lanka Customs Outward Port Clearance from your departure port. Access is only permitted to official ports of entry.\nSri Lanka does not have any sheltered anchorages, so “cruising” here and anchoring is really not an option.

Geographically, these four small states are part of the Caroline Islands, consisting between them of over 600 islands, of which only 65 are inhabited. Also part of Chuuk state are the isolated Mortlocks, Hall Islands and Western Islands.\nThe name “Falalop” means “big island” or “main island” Many atolls in the Outer Islands, likeWoleai, have an island which is called Falalop, meaning it is the main island of that atoll.\nFSM has a population of around 105,000. The official language is English. There are also several local languages spoken including Chuukese, Kosraean, Pohnpeian, Yapese, Ulithian, Woleaian, Nukuoro, and Kapingamarangi.\nThe currency of Micronesia is the United States Dollar. However, some islands such as the Yap Island use other currencies alongside the US dollar. Cash is required for most transactions here. Only in Chuuk is it possible to obtain money using a credit card.\nTime zones vary in the islands. Chuuk time is UTC +10. Pohnpei Standard Time and Kosrae Standard Time are UTC +11.\nMicronesia has a warm tropical climate with little change in temperature throughout the year. January to March is the dry season. SeeWeatherfor additional details.\nFacilities vary widely across the Federation, with basic repair facilities in the main centres and very little in the outer islands. There are fisheries plants in several islands and wherever there is a base for fishing boats, one may be able to find at least a modicum of repair facilities. One should carry a good supply of essential spares as the only parts that may be available locally are those used in trucks or heavy plant in use on the islands.

Hilo is a very pleasant place to unwind after the long passage from mainland USA and also to visit the interior of the spectacular Big Island.\nThe prevailing winds are the NE trades which offer boisterous sailing between island groups as wind and waves are exaggerated by the high mountains (venturi effect).\nIn most places in Hawaii, only part of the sightseeing can be done from the cockpit, as many of the interesting places are either inland or difficult to reach by boat. The Big Island is an excellent introduction to Hawaii with its magnificent Kilauea Volcano, orchid gardens, cane fields, and scenic coastline. A definite stop on the lee side of the island is at Kealakekua Bay, where Captain Cook lost his life in 1778.\nThe former whaling capital of the Pacific, Lahaina on Maui island is another popular cruising stop, as is the marine park at Hulopoe Bay on Lanai with its superb underwater scenery. Busy Honolulu with its excellent facilities has many tempting sights which should include a visit to the Bishop Museum, especially for those planning to continue their cruise to other Pacific islands, as many of the art treasures from these islands have been collected there.\nA good place to take one’s leave from Hawaii is the northernmost island of Kauai and its spectacular Hanalei Bay, the setting for many a South Seas movie.\nIt is currently not permitted to stop at the more remote locations of Midway (or the National Wildlife Refuge or Battle of Midway National Memorial) or Wake Atoll.\nThe number of marinas in Hawaii is less than one would expect in such a developed place and, on the whole, yachting facilities are below US standards. The number of cruising yachts is not very large, except in the summer when many yachts make their way across from the mainland and facilities are stretched to the full.\nMajor repair work and services, such as hauling out and hull, engine and sail repair, are available only at Honokohau Harbour on Hawaii (Big Island), at Kewalo Basin, Keehi Lagoon and at Ala Wai Boat Harbour in Honolulu on Oahu Island. Smaller repairs can be made at Hilo, Lahaina, and Nawiliwili.\nMarine supplies in the main yachting centers are good and there are several chandleries with a wide selection, including charts. Whatever is not available locally will be ordered from the mainland and air freighted to Hawaii in 48 to 72 hours.\nProvisioning is good everywhere and Hawaii is a good place to victual the boat, especially if planning to cruise the outer islands of Micronesia or the South Pacific. However, the prices are 25 percent higher than on the mainland so all non-perishable stores should be bought before leaving the USA.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

This is partly due to the fact that to arrive in Hawaii from the US mainland, yachts must leave US territorial waters.\nHawaii Pre-Arrival Procedures for Yachts\nSee a list of DOBOR district officeshere. It is wise to make contact with the harbor master by e-mail prior to entry, who can normally assist with the application for atemporary mooring permitand give you an indication of berth availability.\nHonolulu is the only port of entry for all animals. Any yachts with pets on board must arrive in Honolulu for inspection and quarantine.\nIt is possible to use theROAM App. here as in the USand other territories for entry clearance.\nYachts must report immediately on arrival to Customs and formal clearance must be made within 48 hours of arrival (either via the ROAM App or in person).\nCustoms working hours are 08:00-16:30 Monday to Friday. (Vessels arriving at the weekend may have to wait until Monday to obtain clearance).\nFor foreign vessels not using the ROAM App., contact the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at 1-808-356-4100. Initial inspection and clearance will be conducted by CBP.\nVessels that have cellphones can call Customs before arriving to minimize the waiting time. After hours, it is necessary to telephone Customs.\nOn arrival, no one must go ashore except for the person reporting the arrival to Customs, who must afterward return to the yacht, until formalities are completed. Violations of this rule can result in heavy penalties, even forfeiture of the boat.\nBorder Patrol/Customs will normally contact the Department of Agriculture, who will come and check for banned food items and animals. You will need to fill out the State of Hawaii Department of AgriculturePlants and Animals Declaration Form.\nGarbage must be double-bagged. In some places, Border Patrol will handle everything. For garbage disposal, you can contact Honolulu Harbors at (808) 587-2050.\nSee Documentsfor the paperwork required on arrival.\nUS vessels arriving from a US port on the mainland who have not stopped at a foreign port en route or have had no contact with any other vessel at sea, and who have only US citizens on board, do not need to clear Customs, but must be inspected on arrival by an agricultural inspector of the State of Hawaii. They must inform the agricultural department of their arrival.\nAfter having cleared into Hawaii, US vessels are free to go anywhere in the USA.\nMost foreign vessels now required to have a cruising license.See Documentsfor further details. Foreign vessels without a cruising license must check in with Customs at every other port they visit. Precise instructions of the procedure will be given at the first port of entry.\nNote that Hawaii now has a schedule of anchoring fees, making it almost as expensive to anchor as it is to moor in a marina.See Feesfor more details.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

See Security for more info.\nThe Republic of Kiribati (pronounced “kiribass”), formerly the Gilbert Islands, is a group of more than 30 islands situated in the centre of the Pacific Ocean around the point where the international dateline and the equator cross.\nBesides the 16 original Gilbert Islands, Kiribati also includes Banaba (Ocean Island), the eight Phoenix Islands, and eight of the 11 Line Islands. All of the islands are low atolls enclosing lagoons, rarely more than four meters (12 feet) above sea level. The notable exception is Banaba, which is volcanic.\nKiribati is very isolated, its small islands spread out over more than one million square miles of ocean. Little grows on these islands except coconut palms and not all of them are inhabited. Kiribati’s future is threatened by rising sea levels.\nThe population on Kiribati is around 110,000 with over half living on Tarawa.\nEnglish is the official language. After Tarawa, Gilbertese and I-Kiribati (or a mix of the two) are more commonly spoken.\nThe Kiribati dollar and the Australian dollar are both used in Kiribati.\nTime zones vary depending on island group. Gilbert Island Time is UTC+12. Phoenix Island Time is UTC +13. Line Islands is UTC +14.\nVisiting this sprawling archipelago requires careful planning. Following the Pandemic there are now only 2 Ports of Entry:Tarawain the Gilbert Islands andKiritimati (Christmas)in the Line Islands. The prevailing winds and currents are from the south. Their remoteness is what makes these islands so intriguing.\nThe Line Islands, together with Washington belong to Kiribati and their local names have been confused and are often wrongly depicted in nautical publications.  Their correct names areKiritimati (Christmas),Fanning (Tabuerean)and Wahington (Teraina).\nKiritimati (Christmas Island)in particular is a convenient stopover point for boats on passage between Hawaii and French Polynesia. The site of former British nuclear tests, the island was handed over to Kiribati on that country’s independence. The island is a sanctuary to millions of seabirds and access to the breeding areas is prohibited.\nFanning Island (Tabuerean), only 257 kilometres (160 miles) farther north, is a typical Pacific island, clean, welcoming and self-sufficient.\nNavigational aids are not very reliable and it is reported that most atolls are without lights after midnight.\nMost facilities available in Kiribati are concentrated onTarawawhich comprises several islands around a lagoon. Facilities and availability of goods on the other islands are basic and limited, but there is plenty of fish everywhere.  Obtaining water can be a problem.  For more information see theYachting Essentialssection.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.

Full details inDocuments. If you have a boat stamp, the officials will be happy.\nA cruising permit should be obtained from Customs when clearing in.\nYou must report to the local police on any island you visit after clearing in to the country; some atolls have a Quarantine officer who may wish to inspect the yacht.\nTo visit other islands during your stay in Kiribati you will need to write a letter to the Principal Immigration Officer requesting permission – at least three days prior to your intended departure. You will also need to clear with Customs to visit other islands. They will provide you with a letter of introduction to give to the local police on arrival, who will want to see your permit letter and crew passports.\nPermission to visit one of the outer islands is granted for a fixed period, usually no more than two weeks, and in some cases permission is not granted at all (for example, currently, permission is not granted to yachts wanting to visit Butaritari (Makin Island).\nKiribati Departure Procedures for Yachts\nThere are only two places to clear out of Kiribati – Tarawa (Gilbert and Phoenix)  and Kiritimati (Line Islands – Fanning, Washington and Kiritimati Islands and Phoenix).Remember that yachts are not allowed to stop at any of the outer islands after making final outward clearance.Before clearing out yachts must pay their port dues at the KPA office (ports office).

Palaun and English are the official languages.\nThe currency is the US dollar.\nThe time zone in Palau is UTC +9.\nPalau lies on the edge of the typhoon belt and is rarely affected by tropical storms. Seeweather.\nConveniently situated on the route from the South Pacific to the Philippines, Palau lagoon and its many picturesque islands provide one of the most beautiful cruising grounds in the Pacific in one small area. This is slightly marred by the strictentry regulations, but this can be overcome by sorting out the necessary paperwork before arrival and, once there, by observing the rules. The effort is entirely justified as the scenery is rarely matched elsewhere in the Pacific. The richest flora and fauna in Micronesia are found here, both on land and underwater.\nCoral reefs and swift currents make all navigation dangerous, especially for newcomers to Palau and particularly after dark.  Be careful and watch for reefs. Koror State Rangers assess steep fines for vessels grounding on coral reefs – $100 to $500 and up.\nThe most fascinating place to visit are the Rock Islands, which are over two hundred limestone islets covered in jungle growth. Three major ocean currents meet in this area bringing food to nourish the rich marine life. The sea is teeming with turtles, manta rays, moray eels, fish of all descriptions, giant clams and even dugong. Occasionally one is brought back to earth by the sight of a wrecked ship from the bloody battles which were fought in and over these waters during the Second World War.\nStrict rules apply to visits to the outer islands and because of many abuses by cruising boats in the past, the authorities treat all visitors with suspicion, and, occasionally, with a certain degree of hostility. It is even rumoured that the authorities are considering closing the Rock Islands to cruising boats altogether.\nAnother fascinating place to visit isHelen Reefwhich is a National Park.\nIf you have information for this section, or feedback on businesses used, please let us know at editor@noonsite.com.
